"1508877986.000067","Tue Oct 24 2017","4:46 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","The case we’re in automatically adds an error; see line 341+ of `form.js`."

"1509374601.000137","Mon Oct 30 2017","10:43 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","The trick to game nights, I think, is that you have to invite people over to play a specific game/games."

"1509374612.000546","Mon Oct 30 2017","10:43 AM","Matt Jardine","it's true"
"1509374618.000530","Mon Oct 30 2017","10:43 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Otherwise, a bunch of people just come over and hang out and then maybe pick the game that the most people know."

"1509374678.000451","Mon Oct 30 2017","10:44 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yes, this is true."

"1509374737.000773","Mon Oct 30 2017","10:45 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Does it become a `do` block?"
"1509374747.000646","Mon Oct 30 2017","10:45 AM","Matt Jardine","so, this is sort of a stylistic thing"
"1509374752.000131","Mon Oct 30 2017","10:45 AM","Matt Jardine","but generally"
"1509374804.000170","Mon Oct 30 2017","10:46 AM","Matt Jardine","``` { |thing|   # stuff } ``` is for when you care about the return value"
"1509374815.000385","Mon Oct 30 2017","10:46 AM","Matt Jardine","like `map` or `any` or `select`"
"1509374819.000139","Mon Oct 30 2017","10:46 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Gross it looks like JavaScript!"
"1509374846.000189","Mon Oct 30 2017","10:47 AM","Matt Jardine","``` do |thing|   # stuff end ``` is for when you don't care about the return value, the important thing is happening within the block"

"1509374881.000206","Mon Oct 30 2017","10:48 AM","Matt Jardine","it is very important"
"1509374886.000080","Mon Oct 30 2017","10:48 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Hahahahaha."
"1509374911.000479","Mon Oct 30 2017","10:48 AM","Matt Jardine","but yeah for instance `each` doesn't return anything useful, so you use `do end`"
"1509374936.000035","Mon Oct 30 2017","10:48 AM","Matt Jardine","I think i'm not actually explaining this well, because it sounds really arbitrary when I read that back"
"1509374949.000482","Mon Oct 30 2017","10:49 AM","Matt Jardine","but it makes sense to me so /shrug"

Can you tell me if I’m debugging this right?   - I used `git log --pretty=oneline` to get a pretty display of all the recent commits to dev. - Then I used `git checkout &lt;commit hash number&gt;` to (I think) mess around with the code locally from that commit. - This service reporter error doesn’t happen on any commit before ``` 0f4621c495a4d180e97798d039ffa48f658b039a Merge pull request #3214 from noteflight/jordi_tempo` ```"

"1515181686.000189","Fri Jan 05 2018","2:48 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So we try not to do things where we _directly_ make people work for us."

"1515181769.000448","Fri Jan 05 2018","2:49 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Okay, and also we’re having a game night tomorrow night."
"1515181794.000263","Fri Jan 05 2018","2:49 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So you probably can’t do _all_ the things with us. I think we will come to grips with that somehow."

"1515513975.000306","Tue Jan 09 2018","11:06 AM","Matt Jardine","I think they started calling it es2015"

"1515514212.000546","Tue Jan 09 2018","11:10 AM","Matt Jardine","i bet that's good training to do sometimes"
"1515514212.000615","Tue Jan 09 2018","11:10 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And waking up this morning was like waking from death."

"1515514475.000279","Tue Jan 09 2018","11:14 AM","Matt Jardine","not entirely, I mean"
"1515514482.000233","Tue Jan 09 2018","11:14 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","In short (not to answer now but just so you understand the nature of the questions I think I have): I don’t super understand how front end stuff talks to back end stuff!

"1515514544.000005","Tue Jan 09 2018","11:15 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And because I’m moving to front end stuff, I’m worried I’m not getting those questions answered."

"1515514569.000414","Tue Jan 09 2018","11:16 AM","Matt Jardine","maybe with a white board"
"1515514571.000363","Tue Jan 09 2018","11:16 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Of course of course!"

"1515514589.000821","Tue Jan 09 2018","11:16 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Oh, and also—"
"1515514660.000061","Tue Jan 09 2018","11:17 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","the Ruiz-Knotts have a dumb little wordpress site that is currently serving as Ivan’s portfolio but that we want to use for a ton of other joint stuff."
"1515514670.000593","Tue Jan 09 2018","11:17 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But I have no idea how to take custom front and and put it on a wordpress site."

"1515514690.000915","Tue Jan 09 2018","11:18 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And that just seems like a super common use case for knowing how to code—"
"1515514696.000399","Tue Jan 09 2018","11:18 AM","Matt Jardine","wordpress is sort of it's own little world"
"1515514700.000843","Tue Jan 09 2018","11:18 AM","Matt Jardine","kind of its own skillset"
"1515514704.000446","Tue Jan 09 2018","11:18 AM","Matt Jardine","that I know very little about"

"1515514753.000068","Tue Jan 09 2018","11:19 AM","Matt Jardine","yeah I guess you could either build something from scratch or learn how wordpress works"
"1515514763.000311","Tue Jan 09 2018","11:19 AM","Matt Jardine","both seem like worthwhile things to do as a developer"

"1515515163.000252","Tue Jan 09 2018","11:26 AM","Matt Jardine","i should ask him, but he's in a meeting so I asked you"

Ours is more like, “skinny controller, fat service, skinny model”. As described above in regard to services - the majority of our code lives in services. Methods that deal solely with doing CRUD on a particular model are cool to put in models, but in general if the operation involves more than one type of model, it doesn’t make much sense for it to live in a model class."

"1522764815.000040","Tue Apr 03 2018","10:13 AM","Matt Jardine","you could try turning off SSL on your local servers"

This is actually true of all the public scores I looked at."
"1522767852.000179","Tue Apr 03 2018","11:04 AM","Matt Jardine","that is strange!"
"1522767855.000900","Tue Apr 03 2018","11:04 AM","Matt Jardine","is it true for new scores, too?"

"1523370442.000933","Tue Apr 10 2018","10:27 AM","Matt Jardine","look at where this thing is used"
"1523370449.000501","Tue Apr 10 2018","10:27 AM","Matt Jardine","author is expected to be provided by the caller"
"1523370472.000004","Tue Apr 10 2018","10:27 AM","Matt Jardine","because it has to be formatted all fancy like"
"1523370599.000860","Tue Apr 10 2018","10:29 AM","Matt Jardine","The reasoning behind this: Formatters are set up to be configurable. Instead of the ProductFormatter making assumptions about how the caller wants the User(author) to be formatted, it leaves that up to the controller, because maybe two controllers have different needs."
"1523370613.000926","Tue Apr 10 2018","10:30 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Cool cool cool."
"1523370642.000793","Tue Apr 10 2018","10:30 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Okay, what about `composer`?"
"1523370663.000668","Tue Apr 10 2018","10:31 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","This seems to just be whatever name is typed into the ‘Composer’ field on the score, yes?"
"1523370679.000421","Tue Apr 10 2018","10:31 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Like, `author` will probably be the creator of the score—"
"1523370702.000383","Tue Apr 10 2018","10:31 AM","Matt Jardine","yeah"
"1523370720.000205","Tue Apr 10 2018","10:32 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","and `composer` is whoever they designated as the composer. (Could be the author themself; could be someone else if they’re arranging something.)"

"1523370754.000492","Tue Apr 10 2018","10:32 AM","Matt Jardine","important to note: For the sake of getting something onto dev I made a lot of assumptions about what information we'd want in this formatter. Some of it might not be quite right."
"1523370762.000751","Tue Apr 10 2018","10:32 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Oh cool."
"1523370782.000935","Tue Apr 10 2018","10:33 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Okay, because we also have this `Marketplace::Contributor`s table."
"1523370789.000139","Tue Apr 10 2018","10:33 AM","Matt Jardine","It seems to me like composer is just a string typed into the score or something"
"1523370797.000478","Tue Apr 10 2018","10:33 AM","Matt Jardine","while author is an actual user model"
"1523370852.000381","Tue Apr 10 2018","10:34 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","It looks to me like we want those actual `Contributor`s instead of the `composer` as gotten here."

"1525880562.000238","Wed May 09 2018","11:42 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","In those cases, it pushes some promises into the `promises` array."

"1526564425.000422","Thu May 17 2018","9:40 AM","Matt Jardine","An important point I wanted to make but forgot is a huge number of people make all of those logical slips without any religious backround. Like re: judging other people and seeing the world as a bunch of false binaries."

"1526564714.000199","Thu May 17 2018","9:45 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","(And, arguably, _does_ in most cases.)"
"1526564722.000813","Thu May 17 2018","9:45 AM","Matt Jardine","yeah I kind of talk in hyperbole a lot of the time"
"1526564752.000486","Thu May 17 2018","9:45 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But I think sometimes the things you are critiquing don’t sound anything like the religion I grew up with."
"1526564764.000433","Thu May 17 2018","9:46 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And I wish I could articulate it better just so we could have better conversation."

"1526564799.000131","Thu May 17 2018","9:46 AM","Matt Jardine","and I can tell that you don't"
"1526564805.000212","Thu May 17 2018","9:46 AM","Matt Jardine","but you disagree silently :stuck_out_tongue:"
"1526564809.000186","Thu May 17 2018","9:46 AM","Matt Jardine","that feels like a cue to shut up"
"1526564812.000334","Thu May 17 2018","9:46 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","No!"
"1526564831.000090","Thu May 17 2018","9:47 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So, if Ivan was _disagreeing_ with you, I’d totally take your side."

"1526564877.000495","Thu May 17 2018","9:47 AM","Matt Jardine","I think your own viewpoint is the underrepresented one"

"1526564894.000153","Thu May 17 2018","9:48 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Mmm—"
"1526564897.000330","Thu May 17 2018","9:48 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","What do you mean?"
"1526564934.000407","Thu May 17 2018","9:48 AM","Matt Jardine","It just seems like you usually have something to say, but you don't"
"1526564959.000924","Thu May 17 2018","9:49 AM","Matt Jardine","like I say something outrageous, and Ivan is like 'yeah pretty much' and you have this look on your face like 'I dunno'"
"1526564977.000704","Thu May 17 2018","9:49 AM","Matt Jardine","like ""I'm not so sure"""
"1526564981.000354","Thu May 17 2018","9:49 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Ah, right."
"1526565014.000279","Thu May 17 2018","9:50 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","My point above is that I’m not sure that’s an actual indication of _my view_."

"1526565060.000340","Thu May 17 2018","9:51 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","That’s a symptom of feeling like there is probably more to explore here if we are all agreeing."

"1526565074.000631","Thu May 17 2018","9:51 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I think we _do_ agree with so many of your critiques of religion."

"1526565157.000598","Thu May 17 2018","9:52 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And in so many ways we see America’s religion as a deep malfunctioning of what faith could be."
"1526565175.000755","Thu May 17 2018","9:52 AM","Matt Jardine","Yeah, but last night I was sort of targeting your brand a little more specifically, right?"

"1526565193.000811","Thu May 17 2018","9:53 AM","Matt Jardine","Really, the crux of my point is that supernatural thinking _of any kind_ is bad for you and the people around you"

"1526915583.000198","Mon May 21 2018","11:13 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Um, I have more questions."
"1526915632.000363","Mon May 21 2018","11:13 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Right now it looks like we keep track of some bits of data around verification on our `seller_legal_entities` model."
"1526915668.000646","Mon May 21 2018","11:14 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","We have `verification_needed`, `verification_needed_by`, and `verification_documents_needed`."
"1526915753.000435","Mon May 21 2018","11:15 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","In George’s designs, he has a verification section show up on the top of the Seller Landing page only after further verification items are requested, and then it remains forever."
"1526915845.000030","Mon May 21 2018","11:17 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I think I want to add some sort of column like `verification_threshold_passed` which flips to `true` the first time `verification.fields_needed` ever contains something."
"1526915853.000102","Mon May 21 2018","11:17 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Is that a sensible way to go about this?"
"1526915919.000679","Mon May 21 2018","11:18 AM","Matt Jardine","remind me, stripe has that status field that's either `unverified` `pending` or `verified` right?"
"1526915950.000383","Mon May 21 2018","11:19 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yes, but it’s _always_ `unverified` until every document they’ll ever ask for is in."
"1526915955.000641","Mon May 21 2018","11:19 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","(Unless it’s pending, I guess.)"
"1526915961.000618","Mon May 21 2018","11:19 AM","Matt Jardine","could you use that to calculate this flag, rather than store it in the database?"
"1526915963.000635","Mon May 21 2018","11:19 AM","Matt Jardine","oh, really?"
"1526915971.000275","Mon May 21 2018","11:19 AM","Matt Jardine","it's literally never `verified`?"
"1526915991.000575","Mon May 21 2018","11:19 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","After SSN and scan of ID are submitted and reviewed, then it will be verified."
"1526915998.000095","Mon May 21 2018","11:19 AM","Matt Jardine","oh, wait right"
"1526916030.000431","Mon May 21 2018","11:20 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So the “default” state before that seems to be: ``` status: 'unverified' fields_needed: [] ```"

"1527187995.000540","Thu May 24 2018","2:53 PM","Matt Jardine","err... actually you want line 77"
"1527188026.000325","Thu May 24 2018","2:53 PM","Matt Jardine","dev uses all of the `default` values"

"1527188086.000744","Thu May 24 2018","2:54 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yeah."

"1528394645.000476","Thu Jun 07 2018","2:04 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Ah, so cute."
"1528394687.000058","Thu Jun 07 2018","2:04 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But I don’t think we have the energy to figure out everything we would need to figure out to make an offer by Tuesday."
"1528394741.000741","Thu Jun 07 2018","2:05 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But the people there representing the seller were super friendly and helpful and we will probably sit down and talk with them more about other properties at some point."
"1528394760.000761","Thu Jun 07 2018","2:06 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So at least this has kicked off the process of us maybe actually being in the market for buying."
"1528394790.000141","Thu Jun 07 2018","2:06 PM","Matt Jardine","That's cool"
"1528394797.000026","Thu Jun 07 2018","2:06 PM","Matt Jardine","I hope it was educational"

"1528396672.000405","Thu Jun 07 2018","2:37 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I don’t know that strange birds would do it for me."
"1528396697.000082","Thu Jun 07 2018","2:38 PM","Matt Jardine","I guess it like drives home the point that even basic things about life you take for granted are different in a place like that"
"1528396700.000168","Thu Jun 07 2018","2:38 PM","Matt Jardine","I think that's what I want"
"1528396708.000653","Thu Jun 07 2018","2:38 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But then you have to move all the time to keep it up!"
"1528396712.000581","Thu Jun 07 2018","2:38 PM","Matt Jardine","like, I'd move to Mars if I could"
"1528396751.000749","Thu Jun 07 2018","2:39 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But that’s _even farther_ away from Somerville than New Zeeland."

"1528396949.000074","Thu Jun 07 2018","2:42 PM","Matt Jardine","and like i've lived in NE for 18 years, if I'm ever going to get a change of scenery there probably isn't a better time than now"

"1528396967.000009","Thu Jun 07 2018","2:42 PM","Matt Jardine","this is too heavy a conversation for work"

"1528396995.000044","Thu Jun 07 2018","2:43 PM","Matt Jardine","especially since I have done more or less nothing so far"
"1528397029.000531","Thu Jun 07 2018","2:43 PM","Matt Jardine","yeah sort of! plus this guy who is like a globe trotter was sleeping in our kitchen and also just reasons"
"1528397117.000645","Thu Jun 07 2018","2:45 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Gosh, I don’t know. Globe trotting sounds exhausting and lonely."

"1528397155.000163","Thu Jun 07 2018","2:45 PM","Matt Jardine","but like I've very purposefully left myself free of commitments and responsibilities"

"1528397173.000471","Thu Jun 07 2018","2:46 PM","Matt Jardine","like just in case some great calling came a long"
"1528397181.000654","Thu Jun 07 2018","2:46 PM","Matt Jardine","I wouldn't be tethered to anything"
"1528397228.000559","Thu Jun 07 2018","2:47 PM","Matt Jardine","or something"

"1528986988.000491","Thu Jun 14 2018","10:36 AM","Matt Jardine","is SCUL an acronym?"
"1528986994.000238","Thu Jun 14 2018","10:36 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","It used to be—"
"1528987000.000114","Thu Jun 14 2018","10:36 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","and now nobody knows what it stands for?"
"1528987007.000175","Thu Jun 14 2018","10:36 AM","Matt Jardine","that's pretty good"
"1528987008.000352","Thu Jun 14 2018","10:36 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Or something like that."
"1528987014.000782","Thu Jun 14 2018","10:36 AM","Matt Jardine","but weird because the founder is still a member"
"1528987021.000616","Thu Jun 14 2018","10:37 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Oh. So probably someone knows."
"1528987030.000720","Thu Jun 14 2018","10:37 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But it doesn’t stand for that anymore, I guess."
"1528987032.000323","Thu Jun 14 2018","10:37 AM","Matt Jardine","maybe it just doesn't really apply anymore"
"1528987036.000138","Thu Jun 14 2018","10:37 AM","Matt Jardine","but it's still a cool name"

"1528987088.000258","Thu Jun 14 2018","10:38 AM","Matt Jardine","we could ask 49-day-street"
"1528987100.000197","Thu Jun 14 2018","10:38 AM","Matt Jardine","or we could install tinder"
"1528987105.000012","Thu Jun 14 2018","10:38 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Ha!"
"1528987114.000822","Thu Jun 14 2018","10:38 AM","Matt Jardine","we should get tinder just to find board game people"

"1528987274.000891","Thu Jun 14 2018","10:41 AM","Matt Jardine","no use in thinking about it that way I guess"
"1528987277.000685","Thu Jun 14 2018","10:41 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Way back in May that was the plan—"
"1528987285.000412","Thu Jun 14 2018","10:41 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","and then we just forgot."
"1528987291.000116","Thu Jun 14 2018","10:41 AM","Matt Jardine","I didn't know about this workshop thing, I don't think"

"1528992752.000806","Thu Jun 14 2018","12:12 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","YAY!"
"1528997103.000386","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:25 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Hello! Some questions for you …"
"1528997126.000618","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:25 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I don’t know if you’ll remember this, but we chatted a little about it at the time:"
"1528997149.000257","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:25 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I changed the `verification_needed` column on `SellerLegalEntities` to `verification_requested`—"
"1528997167.000725","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:26 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And also changed what it means."
"1528997214.000671","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:26 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","We thought that was an okay idea at the time because we weren’t sure what used the `verification_needed` column that couldn’t be derived from the `verification_documents_needed` column."
"1528997237.000420","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:27 PM","Matt Jardine","yeah, I remember"
"1528997240.000334","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:27 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","(`verification_needed` used to just be set based on `verification_documents_needed &gt; 0`, or something like that.)"
"1528997246.000118","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:27 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Cool cool cool."
"1528997277.000459","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:27 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But it seems the admin is was using that `verification_needed` column as a sort order."
"1528997292.000095","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:28 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I am trying to fix the breaking `admin_listing_test`."
"1528997296.000493","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:28 PM","Matt Jardine","ah"
"1528997304.000382","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:28 PM","Matt Jardine","so the admin is basically all random garbage"
"1528997307.000705","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:28 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott",":smile:"
"1528997323.000548","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:28 PM","Matt Jardine","if it makes it easier, you can even just remove verification_needed as a sort order"
"1528997324.000431","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:28 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","You can’t say that! My friend worked on it!"
"1528997336.000300","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:28 PM","Matt Jardine","though verification_requested might be a perfectly good sort order"
"1528997345.000447","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:29 PM","Matt Jardine","and you can just find/replace for it in the admin code"
"1528997352.000432","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:29 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","_Maybe_—"
"1528997367.000291","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:29 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","It is a totally (well, slightly) different thing, though."
"1528997372.000611","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:29 PM","Matt Jardine","verification_requested is a boolean, yeah?"
"1528997377.000320","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:29 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yes—"
"1528997393.000774","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:29 PM","Matt Jardine","yeah it means something different, but it still might be nice to be able to sort by it"
"1528997400.000312","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:30 PM","Matt Jardine","or not"
"1528997403.000029","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:30 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","practically speaking, that just indicates whether or not the user has passed the selling threshold that triggers verification, etc."
"1528997410.000750","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:30 PM","Matt Jardine","nobody like specced out which columns should or shouldn't be sortable in the admin"
"1528997413.000865","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:30 PM","Matt Jardine","I just made some guesses"
"1528997414.000542","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:30 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","That’s very different than “these users need to do something now.”"
"1528997434.000058","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:30 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Ah okay okay."
"1528997444.000209","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:30 PM","Matt Jardine","is there any sort of 'these users need to do something now' flag?"
"1528997450.000812","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:30 PM","Matt Jardine","it's like a collection of flags now, right?"
"1528997455.000174","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:30 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So you are saying nobody cares and it’s up to me and no one will notice if I quietly let this die."
"1528997460.000553","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:31 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Um—"
"1528997462.000539","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:31 PM","Matt Jardine","that is what I am saying"
"1528997475.000324","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:31 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yeah, right now there is no one single flag."
"1528997484.000235","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:31 PM","Matt Jardine","but there are a few flags"
"1528997495.000346","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:31 PM","Matt Jardine","it might be cool to add those flags to the admin"
"1528997504.000529","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:31 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","It is still `verification_documents_needed &gt; 0`."
"1528997512.000664","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:31 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I mean, that would be the indicator."
"1528997523.000467","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:32 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","We just don’t have a separate column representing that anymore."
"1528997534.000563","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:32 PM","Matt Jardine","but aren't there like needsPID and needsDocument flags or something ?"
"1528997581.000123","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:33 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","By “flag”, do you mean something other than column?"
"1528997587.000065","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:33 PM","Matt Jardine","no I mean the column"
"1528997594.000159","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:33 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Nope."
"1528997612.000321","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:33 PM","Matt Jardine","in your branch"
"1528997616.000184","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:33 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","The `verification_documents_needed` column would contain an array of whatever is needed."
"1528997622.000416","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:33 PM","Matt Jardine","ah ok"
"1528997628.000315","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:33 PM","Matt Jardine","verification_fields_needed"
"1528997629.000228","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:33 PM","Matt Jardine","right?"
"1528997641.000221","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:34 PM","Matt Jardine","like it's not just for documents, it includes the SSN check too"
"1528997659.000562","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:34 PM","Matt Jardine","in any case: I say just remove that sort order from the admin"
"1528997665.000818","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:34 PM","Matt Jardine","I imagine at some point we'll want to put it back"
"1528997680.000322","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:34 PM","Matt Jardine","or rather put something in its place"
"1528997692.000118","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:34 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","`fields` would be a better name, as it behaves as you describe (including SSN)."
"1528997693.000457","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:34 PM","Matt Jardine","but that shouldn't be now"
"1528997705.000333","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:35 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But right now it is called `verification_documents_needed`. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
"1528997711.000109","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:35 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Didn’t _you_ do that?"
"1528997711.000358","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:35 PM","Matt Jardine","oh well"
"1528997723.000652","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:35 PM","Matt Jardine","yeah I maybe didn't intend for it to have the SSN :stuck_out_tongue:"
"1528997735.000735","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:35 PM","Matt Jardine","doesn't stripe's webhook come back with verification__fields__needed?"
"1528997742.000347","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:35 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yes!"
"1528997747.000655","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:35 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And those get put into this column."
"1528997758.000662","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:35 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","That can be SSN, bank account, date of birth, whatever."
"1528997770.000550","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:36 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But those others would be rare cases—"
"1528997771.000368","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:36 PM","Matt Jardine","yeah, I bet I just screwed"
"1528997780.000709","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:36 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","we just use it primarily for ssn and id documents."
"1528997788.000604","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:36 PM","Matt Jardine","so yes in conclusion"
"1528997806.000823","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:36 PM","Matt Jardine","just remove the column from the admin"
"1528997816.000538","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:36 PM","Matt Jardine","that seems like the right thing to do"
"1528997817.000255","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:36 PM","Matt Jardine","to me"
"1528997831.000625","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:37 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","—_or_ put back the `verification_needed` column."
"1528997840.000155","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:37 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","As it was."
"1528997845.000773","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:37 PM","Matt Jardine","oh"
"1528997847.000307","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:37 PM","Matt Jardine","hm"
"1528997853.000236","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:37 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","It does seem useful."
"1528997861.000825","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:37 PM","Matt Jardine","_or_"
"1528997866.000744","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:37 PM","Matt Jardine","derive it in the client"
"1528997870.000441","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:37 PM","Matt Jardine","in the admin"
"1528997897.000151","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:38 PM","Matt Jardine","there's a way to do that"
"1528997929.000040","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:38 PM","Matt Jardine","make up a fake column called 'verification_needed' whose contents is derived by looking at 'documents_needed'"
"1528997945.000326","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:39 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","In the client? What?"
"1528997949.000265","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:39 PM","Matt Jardine","in the admin"
"1528997954.000901","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:39 PM","Matt Jardine","I can show you how to do that"
"1528997973.000522","Thu Jun 14 2018","1:39 PM","Matt Jardine","my explanation right then was not intended to make a whole lot of sense"

"1530024639.000381","Tue Jun 26 2018","10:50 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","but they took _hours_!"
"1530024742.000699","Tue Jun 26 2018","10:52 AM","Matt Jardine","dispiriting"

"1530024824.000705","Tue Jun 26 2018","10:53 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But then on the site it was like “Something went wrong, check the logs.”"

"1530025288.000595","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:01 AM","Matt Jardine","in what way?"
"1530025352.000417","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:02 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Remember this question? ``` For instance, the situation had been:  status: 'unverified' fields_needed: ['legal_entity.verification.document']  The user then submits the document, and the values become:  status: 'pending' fields_needed: ???

"1530025391.000599","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:03 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","What I understood from their answer was that YES, `fields_needed` remains populated until verification."

"1530025512.000184","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:05 AM","Matt Jardine","so it's misleading but maybe not the end of the world"
"1530025519.000062","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:05 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Right."
"1530025520.000647","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:05 AM","Matt Jardine","i mean, it def should be fixed"

"1530025545.000299","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:05 AM","Matt Jardine","are we saving enough information to fix this?"
"1530025564.000501","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:06 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So right now, this is the information we have:  In our database: ``` personal_id_submitted: true/false verification_document_submitted: true/false ```"

"1530026070.000150","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:14 AM","Matt Jardine","I guess you can infer that the 'status' relates to the thing that just changed, but it's not _guaranteed_ to be the case"

"1530026082.000117","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:14 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Right."
"1530026083.000829","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:14 AM","Matt Jardine","yeah true"
"1530026118.000923","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:15 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Like, it’s `null` until it shows up in `fields_needed` from Stripe. The webhook sets it to `needed.`"
"1530026119.000364","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:15 AM","Matt Jardine","I would explain this problem in great detail to george"
"1530026133.000429","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:15 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","When the user submits it, we ourselves change it to `pending`."
"1530026174.000133","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:16 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","When the next webhook comes through, we check if the status is now back to `unverified` and it is not in `fields_needed`, in which case we flip to `verified` (for that field)."

"1530026268.000641","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:17 AM","Matt Jardine","Let me think for a second"
"1530026290.000121","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:18 AM","Matt Jardine","If two items change in stripe"

"1530026298.000243","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:18 AM","Matt Jardine","all we know is the accounts status"
"1530026301.000355","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:18 AM","Matt Jardine","not the individual items"
"1530026312.000434","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:18 AM","Matt Jardine","is that right?"
"1530026350.000481","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:19 AM","Matt Jardine","I think your solution would work most of the time, but I'm afraid of corner cases leaving our database in a mess"

"1530026411.000144","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:20 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So, yeah, maybe the answer is talking to George."

"1530026420.000850","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:20 AM","Matt Jardine","why I bring up george"
"1530026447.000146","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:20 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","It’s not really the individual items under review; it’s the account under review when the items are submitted."

"1530026465.000764","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:21 AM","Matt Jardine","you have information that the two fields are submitted"

"1530026491.000325","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:21 AM","Matt Jardine","that's really all we can know with certainty"

"1530026497.000730","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:21 AM","Matt Jardine","so that is what the UI should reflect"
"1530026515.000284","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:21 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","yeah, and—come to think of it—that’s all Stripe’s own UI only shows for this."
"1530026517.000290","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:21 AM","Matt Jardine","plus I think it's like enough"
"1530026543.000792","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:22 AM","Matt Jardine","I think what you have in the database can make a good experience, but it's just not _exactly_ the one designed"
"1530026572.000746","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:22 AM","Matt Jardine","and instead of adding a whole bunch of moving parts to the back end, there might be a more elegant change to the front end that would get us to a good place"
"1530026586.000705","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:23 AM","Matt Jardine","I could be wrong though, maybe george and jon wont like that"

"1530026595.000361","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:23 AM","Matt Jardine","like, that would work"
"1530026606.000340","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:23 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So, right now the UI is designed to show “Pending” or “Verified” on each item."
"1530026607.000385","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:23 AM","Matt Jardine","in 99... honestly probably 100% of the cases"
"1530026636.000877","Tue Jun 26 2018","11:23 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I think I can convince George to just show “submitted” in both cases under each item, with the “Pending” or “Verified” state still showing at the top over all."

"1531500207.000173","Fri Jul 13 2018","12:43 PM","Matt Jardine","I like the point in this flirting one about how sometimes somebody signaling that they _would_ want to do sex with you if the circumstances were a little different is pretty close to being as good as going through with it"
"1531500268.000352","Fri Jul 13 2018","12:44 PM","Matt Jardine","sex has a lot to do with acceptance and respect and stuff, and I can definitely pick out really _good_ moments in my life where things didn't quite work out"

"1531500629.000093","Fri Jul 13 2018","12:50 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Oh, what do you mean by that? Do you mean that part of flirting is like, “I would _love_ you if circumstances were different” instead of just “I would do sex with you if circumstances were different”?"

"1531500710.000351","Fri Jul 13 2018","12:51 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yeah! Probably that makes more sense."
"1531500722.000435","Fri Jul 13 2018","12:52 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Because I’m trying to square this with how women seem to not like catcalling."
"1531500724.000365","Fri Jul 13 2018","12:52 PM","Matt Jardine","like ""this could have been a real thing and we are extremely compatible humans and I have feelings for you, expect for some reason I got into a bad and complicated relationship with your room mate and now I'm moving to Seattle"""

"1531500812.000140","Fri Jul 13 2018","12:53 PM","Matt Jardine","to your point about cat calling"
"1531500864.000039","Fri Jul 13 2018","12:54 PM","Matt Jardine","another smart thing this Alain de Botton guy said is something like (paraphrasing hard) the whole deal with sex is it's not something you'd want to do with just anyone"
"1531500881.000482","Fri Jul 13 2018","12:54 PM","Matt Jardine","it's stuff that would be revolting with _most people_"
"1531500904.000549","Fri Jul 13 2018","12:55 PM","Matt Jardine","which is sort of the point because it's like ""hey I think you are so wonderful that this revolting thing is actually extremely great!"""
"1531500928.000348","Fri Jul 13 2018","12:55 PM","Matt Jardine","and so like anything that is romantic or sexy or whatever is completely the opposite if it's not from the right person"

"1531501007.000372","Fri Jul 13 2018","12:56 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Though one other thing I’m not _quite_ sold on is that this video seems to imply that it’s _important_ to feel sexually attractive."
"1531501016.000187","Fri Jul 13 2018","12:56 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And I’m like, what? Why?"
"1531501060.000229","Fri Jul 13 2018","12:57 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Maybe because women are told this ALL THE TIME and I think it would be cool sometimes if it was like, what? You’re not sexy? Oh, you’ve also never taken a class in underwater basket-weaving? And I wish those were equivalent."

"1531501109.000367","Fri Jul 13 2018","12:58 PM","Matt Jardine","yeah"
"1531501130.000098","Fri Jul 13 2018","12:58 PM","Matt Jardine","I mean it does feel good to feel sexually attractive to the right people"
"1531501140.000134","Fri Jul 13 2018","12:59 PM","Matt Jardine","but you are right about it being kind of tragic if it is _important_"
"1531501140.000167","Fri Jul 13 2018","12:59 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yeah!"
"1531501146.000367","Fri Jul 13 2018","12:59 PM","Matt Jardine","like some people just aren't and never will be"
"1531501149.000139","Fri Jul 13 2018","12:59 PM","Matt Jardine","so what about those folks"
"1531501152.000249","Fri Jul 13 2018","12:59 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And it would probably feel great to be _really_ good at underwater basket weaving!"
"1531501185.000533","Fri Jul 13 2018","12:59 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Because it feels good to be really _any_ positive characteristic."

"1531501211.000061","Fri Jul 13 2018","1:00 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","whatever. You get it and I have to go."
"1531501228.000215","Fri Jul 13 2018","1:00 PM","Matt Jardine","I guess sexual attraction is and always has been and always will be a theme in every humans life"
"1531501239.000076","Fri Jul 13 2018","1:00 PM","Matt Jardine","in a way that is not true for basket weaving"
"1531501256.000498","Fri Jul 13 2018","1:00 PM","Matt Jardine","like, sex is relevant to just about everyone, at least at some point in their lives"
"1531501315.000234","Fri Jul 13 2018","1:01 PM","Matt Jardine","but yeah I think you are right and I'm not really trying to defend the video. If it focused more on the `~ human bond ~` rather than sex it would be more impactful IMO"
"1531501379.000452","Fri Jul 13 2018","1:02 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I think I _liked_ the video I’m just trying to reconcile it with some other things I’ve absorbed on the topic."

"1531948213.000006","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:10 PM","Matt Jardine","i have no idea"
"1531948234.000346","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:10 PM","Matt Jardine","i am doing it to be nice"
"1531948261.000178","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:11 PM","Matt Jardine","like it sucks to see somebody you have feelings for but cannot act on, but at the same time that's all you want to do"
"1531948268.000233","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:11 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yep."
"1531948280.000411","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:11 PM","Matt Jardine","so it's  totally based on how she feels"
"1531948300.000174","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:11 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I mean—are you entirely immune though?"
"1531948301.000120","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:11 PM","Matt Jardine","the gym is less, like, intimate that sabbath"
"1531948318.000199","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:11 PM","Matt Jardine","to your question: no, absolutely not"
"1531948328.000260","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:12 PM","Matt Jardine","but I imagine things are way lopsided there"
"1531948424.000449","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:13 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I ended things with a guy I had sort-of been with all through high school a few weeks after graduation."

"1531948442.000301","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:14 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Then it was okay when I saw him again."
"1531948451.000249","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:14 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","What’s that—2, 3 months?"
"1531948454.000102","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:14 PM","Matt Jardine","how did he feel?"
"1531948475.000070","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:14 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","We didn’t directly discuss it, but things _seemed_ okay."
"1531948478.000288","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:14 PM","Matt Jardine","ok"
"1531948490.000279","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:14 PM","Matt Jardine","that is good"
"1531948531.000189","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:15 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But I remember marking that as a note to self that “things can be okay if you have a definite period of not seeing each other at all for long enough.”"
"1531948548.000438","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:15 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Ivan, on the other hand, kind of kept hanging out with his ex and started dating her again and it was super terrible and messy."
"1531948664.000087","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:17 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Anyway, I think there just needs to be time for the two parties involved to establish their own new routines and lives."
"1531948694.000260","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:18 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","It _might_ actually help her in some way to know you’re dating other people in that regard. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
"1531948837.000325","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:20 PM","Matt Jardine","I think it would have her in some way if _she_ started dating other people"
"1531948856.000123","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:20 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","True."
"1531948868.000339","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:21 PM","Matt Jardine","I want to say that it could be like earth shattering for her to learn i'm already dating people"
"1531948871.000359","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:21 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Come to think of it, when I saw the guy again after the summer he was starting to see someone else."
"1531948873.000421","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:21 PM","Matt Jardine","but then again I have no idea how she feels"
"1531948897.000356","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:21 PM","Matt Jardine","... i have some idea"
"1531948974.000295","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:22 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","When was the last time you guys had any sort of contact?"

"1531949187.000199","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:26 PM","Matt Jardine","seemed fine"
"1531949203.000123","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:26 PM","Matt Jardine","man i really dislike jasmine"

"1531949222.000232","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:27 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott",":poop: I’m not supposed to talk to you!"
"1531949225.000244","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:27 PM","Matt Jardine","the whole world of javascript testing is just so messy"
"1531949229.000221","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:27 PM","Matt Jardine","nah it's okay"
"1531949239.000094","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:27 PM","Matt Jardine","I spent the majority of my day waiting for webpack to compile"
"1531949243.000338","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:27 PM","Matt Jardine","19 seconds at a time"
"1531949301.000036","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:28 PM","Matt Jardine","I liked talking about the letter the other day"
"1531949311.000287","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:28 PM","Matt Jardine","I'd say we should write more letters but I don't really have anything else to say"

"1531949517.000318","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:31 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So much."
"1531949529.000304","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:32 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","It was nice to process a piece of writing like that in person."
"1531949547.000308","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:32 PM","Matt Jardine","I got so much attention!"
"1531949572.000067","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:32 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Haha"
"1531949585.000029","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:33 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Thank you for the nice things you said about us."

"1531949857.000390","Wed Jul 18 2018","5:37 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I will tell you again some other time so it doesn’t seem like I’m just copying you."

"1532011301.000624","Thu Jul 19 2018","10:41 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Okay I am _already_ too cold so there is again a refuge in the office."
"1532011313.000010","Thu Jul 19 2018","10:41 AM","Matt Jardine","ok neat"
"1532011324.000241","Thu Jul 19 2018","10:42 AM","Matt Jardine","hey I think I was sorta mean to you last night re: laughing a lot"
"1532011332.000529","Thu Jul 19 2018","10:42 AM","Matt Jardine","it's good to laugh a lot"
"1532011362.000365","Thu Jul 19 2018","10:42 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Right. This is probably why I’m happy!  Matt Jardine: or maybe the other way around Olivia Ruiz-Knott: _Maybe_."
"1532011370.000179","Thu Jul 19 2018","10:42 AM","Matt Jardine","there's a bunch of stuff about me I really hope never rubs off on you, that's one of em. haha"

"1532011495.000522","Thu Jul 19 2018","10:44 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But I mean—"
"1532011502.000455","Thu Jul 19 2018","10:45 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I can’t keep a straight face for :shit:"
"1532011523.000054","Thu Jul 19 2018","10:45 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And lots of studies show that smiling _makes you_ happier [citation needed]."
"1532011562.000726","Thu Jul 19 2018","10:46 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So what if whatever biological predisposition or inability I have around suppressing laughter is the reason for my general life satisfaction?"
"1532011563.000070","Thu Jul 19 2018","10:46 AM","Matt Jardine","I think that was one of those studies that was famously not reproduceable"
"1532011564.000190","Thu Jul 19 2018","10:46 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
"1532011601.000212","Thu Jul 19 2018","10:46 AM","Matt Jardine","you know how girls hate it when people tell them they 'should smile more'"
"1532011605.000505","Thu Jul 19 2018","10:46 AM","Matt Jardine","apparently I don't like it either :stuck_out_tongue:"
"1532011621.000181","Thu Jul 19 2018","10:47 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Hahaha"
"1532011625.000734","Thu Jul 19 2018","10:47 AM","Matt Jardine","that seems like a super simplistic approach to happiness"
"1532011721.000128","Thu Jul 19 2018","10:48 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yeah, and a pretty privileged one."
"1532011763.000558","Thu Jul 19 2018","10:49 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Oh, well, maybe not, never mind."
"1532011776.000196","Thu Jul 19 2018","10:49 AM","Matt Jardine","Oh, you're poor? Well, _I_ got over being poor by just having a bunch of money!"
"1532011777.000007","Thu Jul 19 2018","10:49 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Probably garbage anyway."
"1532011857.000260","Thu Jul 19 2018","10:50 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But it’s true what you said about the scarcity of laughter making it more valuable"
"1532011909.000514","Thu Jul 19 2018","10:51 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I mean, Ivan and I still congratulate each other smugly if you laughed at any of our jokes in a given evening."
"1532012002.000506","Thu Jul 19 2018","10:53 AM","Matt Jardine","I don't even think I'm really that stingy with laughter"
"1532012006.000314","Thu Jul 19 2018","10:53 AM","Matt Jardine","I guess I wouldn't know"
"1532012016.000288","Thu Jul 19 2018","10:53 AM","Matt Jardine","I suppose if I am going to communicate something, I want to mean it"
"1532012021.000071","Thu Jul 19 2018","10:53 AM","Matt Jardine","that seems like the kind way to go about it, to me"
"1532012049.000626","Thu Jul 19 2018","10:54 AM","Matt Jardine","but that doesn't have to be how everyone approaches laughter"
"1532012105.000520","Thu Jul 19 2018","10:55 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Okay well I forgive you for being mean."
"1532012123.000102","Thu Jul 19 2018","10:55 AM","Matt Jardine","thank you!"

"1533587116.000422","Mon Aug 06 2018","4:25 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I know I can do `Marketplace::Product.active` because on line ~22 of `product.rb` we’ve defined a scope that says `.active` returns all the products where the `active` column is true."

"1534788152.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:02 PM","Matt Jardine","how was pasta?"
"1534788185.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:03 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Very filling. Thanks.  I know I could ask this in dev-chat, but sometimes I get tired of not understanding and repeatedly asking follow-up questions publicly:"
"1534788204.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:03 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I’m trying to upgrade Elasticsearch."
"1534788211.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:03 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Do you know how to do that?"
"1534788220.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:03 PM","Matt Jardine","yeah"
"1534788227.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:03 PM","Matt Jardine","I wish it was better than this but"
"1534788233.000200","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:03 PM","Matt Jardine","you just have to download it from their website"
"1534788236.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:03 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I have downloaded 6.2.4"
"1534788242.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:04 PM","Matt Jardine","ok cool"
"1534788247.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:04 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I started following the steps here: <https://github.com/noteflight/webapp#elasticsearch-setup-webappsite>"
"1534788249.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:04 PM","Matt Jardine","have you extracted it somewhere on your computer?"
"1534788255.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:04 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yep yep."
"1534788261.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:04 PM","Matt Jardine","sweet"
"1534788269.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:04 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","This:"
"1534788271.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:04 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","You’ll also need to add Elasticsearch to your path for the test suite.  export ELASTICSEARCH_PATH=“&lt;elasticsearch install dir&gt;/bin” export PATH=“$PATH:$ELASTICSEARCH_PATH”"
"1534788274.000300","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:04 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Where do I do that?"
"1534788276.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:04 PM","Matt Jardine","yeah"
"1534788309.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:05 PM","Matt Jardine","ok so technically you have to do that whenever you open up a new terminal window, if you want the tests to run in that window"
"1534788346.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:05 PM","Matt Jardine","luckily: there is a handy file called `bash_profile` which is a bash script that gets run whenever you start up a terminal"
"1534788364.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:06 PM","Matt Jardine","so you can add those `export` lines to your `bash_profile` file"
"1534788382.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:06 PM","Matt Jardine","`atom ~/.bash_profile` should open it up"
"1534788401.000200","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:06 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Is that hidden?"
"1534788405.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:06 PM","Matt Jardine","very good!"
"1534788419.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:06 PM","Matt Jardine","yep, that's what the `.` means"
"1534788432.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:07 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Oh interesting."
"1534788452.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:07 PM","Matt Jardine","unix! :neckbeard:"
"1534788487.000200","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:08 PM","Matt Jardine","so, trivia about this whole PATH thing"
"1534788500.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:08 PM","Matt Jardine","PATH is an environment variable that your computer uses to know where to look from programs"
"1534788539.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:08 PM","Matt Jardine","if you do `echo $PATH` you'll see a big list of directories separated by `:`s"
"1534788554.000200","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:09 PM","Matt Jardine","those are the paths your computer will look when you try to execute a command"
"1534788599.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:09 PM","Matt Jardine","for instance if you do `which ls` it will show you that it found the `ls` command at `/bin/ls`"
"1534788620.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:10 PM","Matt Jardine","you'll notice that `/bin` shows up in your PATH list"
"1534788662.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:11 PM","Matt Jardine","so in essence this step is just telling your computer where to find elastic search"
"1534788674.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:11 PM","Matt Jardine","I'm sure that's more than you wanted to know!"
"1534788681.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:11 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","That was great!"
"1534788703.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:11 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yeah, cuz now this shows up there: `/Users/livvy/elasticsearch-6.2.4/bin`"
"1534788711.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:11 PM","Matt Jardine","sweet!"
"1534788735.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:12 PM","Matt Jardine","so now in all _new_ terminal windows your tests should work"
"1534788756.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:12 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Cool. But would this have prevented elasticsearch from working in non-tests?"
"1534788764.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:12 PM","Matt Jardine","PS I ended up making a ~/elasticsearch/ directory without the version number"
"1534788773.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:12 PM","Matt Jardine","so I could upgrade without messing with the path"
"1534788777.000200","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:12 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","That make sense."
"1534788786.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:13 PM","Matt Jardine","and no I don't think so"
"1534788791.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:13 PM","Matt Jardine","re: non-tests"
"1534788805.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:13 PM","Matt Jardine","you do have to make sure the elastic search server is running locally"
"1534788816.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:13 PM","Matt Jardine","and you'll need to recreate/import all of the indexes"
"1534788920.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:15 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Hmm. I think my shortcuts are what’s messing me up."
"1534788934.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:15 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","In my `.profile`, I have this `alias es=""cd ~/elasticsearch-6.2.4 &amp;&amp; bin/elasticsearch""` line."
"1534788968.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:16 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But if I check in the terminal: ```  2018-08-20 14:13:45 ⌚ |ruby-2.4.3| Noteflights-MacBook-Pro in ~/elasticsearch-5.4.0 ○ → alias es alias es='cd ~/elasticsearch-5.4.0 &amp;&amp; bin/elasticsearch' ```"
"1534788979.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:16 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Shoot. Maybe I just need to restart iTerm."
"1534789106.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:18 PM","Matt Jardine","or I bet just open a new window"
"1534789119.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:18 PM","Matt Jardine","or you could manually run .profile"
"1534789131.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:18 PM","Matt Jardine","`~/.profile` will do the trick I think"

"1534790620.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","2:43 PM","Matt Jardine","it might just mean it's looking for a specific record that doesn't exist in the index"

"1534795829.000200","Mon Aug 20 2018","4:10 PM","Matt Jardine","though I seem to remember there being something about text fields vs keyword fields causing problems like this in ES"

"1534796075.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","4:14 PM","Matt Jardine","so here's a possible reason:"
"1534796103.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","4:15 PM","Matt Jardine","if you try to add something to an ES index when the index doesn't already exist, it just creates an index based on the thing you are adding"
"1534796139.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","4:15 PM","Matt Jardine","like if you try to add a 'product' with a couple of text fields, but there is no existing product index, it will try to be smart and create an index with two text fields for you"
"1534796153.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","4:15 PM","Matt Jardine","the trouble is it doesn't know if it should create 'text' or 'keyword' fields"
"1534796165.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","4:16 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Ah, I see."
"1534796171.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","4:16 PM","Matt Jardine","(i dont know the difference between text and keyword fields)"
"1534796178.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","4:16 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Hehe"
"1534796181.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","4:16 PM","Matt Jardine","so we really don't want it to create the index for us"
"1534796190.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","4:16 PM","Matt Jardine","we want to do it with the rake task"
"1534796204.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","4:16 PM","Matt Jardine","maybe on your machine something happened that caused it to create the index on its own"
"1534796215.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","4:16 PM","Matt Jardine","every time you tried to wipe it"
"1534796254.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","4:17 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Mm. Yeah, all the other times I was just dropping/recreating everything; this last time I just did searchable_product."

"1534798842.000200","Mon Aug 20 2018","5:00 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And I think not feeling great shortened my patience for that sort of thing."

"1534799211.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","5:06 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","You did watch Ingrid Goes West, right?"
"1534799218.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","5:06 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","It feels like that."
"1534799234.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","5:07 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Like, the same kind of stress but a little less, actually."
"1534799238.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","5:07 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And it’s less absurd."
"1534799251.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","5:07 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","That’s not necessarily what I liked."
"1534799284.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","5:08 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","It just feels like a really idealistic portrayal of what it’s like to be in 8th grade in the present day."
"1534799295.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","5:08 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And you are really rooting for the main character."

"1534799437.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","5:10 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Like, you _really_ feel the moments of sadness or anticipation or nervousness or whatever that the character is feeling—"
"1534799443.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","5:10 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","and also the moments of triumph."
"1534799451.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","5:10 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And it feels great."
"1534799540.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","5:12 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Like, there is a moment where the girl prays for something—"
"1534799558.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","5:12 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","and I found myself sobbing and praying for that for her too."
"1534799561.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","5:12 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Which of course is ridiculous—"
"1534799567.000100","Mon Aug 20 2018","5:12 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","but that’s how much I wanted it for her."

"1534859299.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","9:48 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Oh, also, I thought my jittery-ness was _from_ the caffeine—"
"1534859318.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","9:48 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","but then my friend was saying it’s from the caffeine _withdrawal_."

"1534859530.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","9:52 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Like, the jitters are from my body reacting to the loss of caffeine in my system."

"1534859558.000200","Tue Aug 21 2018","9:52 AM","Matt Jardine","maybe!"
"1534859578.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","9:52 AM","Matt Jardine","there's a lot of weird myth surrounding coffee"

"1534859636.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","9:53 AM","Matt Jardine","for instance I saw a meta study that pointed out that there is evidence that 1 cup a day is linked to heart disease, but 2 cups a day is linked to better heart health"

"1534874895.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","2:08 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But I can see it."
"1534874910.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","2:08 PM","Matt Jardine","how was your weekend?"
"1534874922.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","2:08 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I am trying not too look while you type because that’s weird."
"1534874942.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","2:09 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Um, mostly it was D&amp;D!"
"1534874962.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","2:09 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I spent a long time on Saturday fleshing out my character that I want to scrap entirely now for something more simple and silly."
"1534874977.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","2:09 PM","Matt Jardine","that's probably a good idea"
"1534874984.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","2:09 PM","Matt Jardine","let the complicated stuff emerge"
"1534874989.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","2:09 PM","Matt Jardine","instead of dictating it beforehand"
"1534882708.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","4:18 PM","Matt Jardine","i really like this soundtrack you sent yesterday"
"1534882726.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","4:18 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I’m glad!"
"1534882735.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","4:18 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Ivan and I have been listening to it Joe-Pera style!"
"1534882743.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","4:19 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I’m surprised I’m not listening to it now, actually."
"1534882753.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","4:19 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","It makes me want to see the movie again just to pay attention to ~the music~ how the music is used."
"1534882809.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","4:20 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","The “Nautilus” song—I figured out what part of the movie it’s in: the pool party scene."
"1534882816.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","4:20 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Which I know doesn’t mean anything to you."
"1534882843.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","4:20 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But I realized that that probably feels so much like _a scene_ that can be called out like that _because_ that song is underscoring it."
"1534882866.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","4:21 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Like, it feels really dramatic."
"1534882874.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","4:21 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","It likely wouldn’t’ve stood out with other sorts of music."
"1534882878.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","4:21 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Or not as much."

"1534885781.000200","Tue Aug 21 2018","5:09 PM","Matt Jardine","also if you let spotify to a radio station based off of the soundtrack some real good stuff comes out"

"1534885923.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","5:12 PM","Matt Jardine","or envious I guess"
"1534885931.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","5:12 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Oh. Which is which?"
"1534885950.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","5:12 PM","Matt Jardine","jealous is when you are possessive of something you have"
"1534885957.000300","Tue Aug 21 2018","5:12 PM","Matt Jardine","envious is when you want something you don't"
"1534885982.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","5:13 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Oh! Are you also covetous then?"
"1534885999.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","5:13 PM","Matt Jardine","is covetous any different than envious?"
"1534886012.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","5:13 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Seems the same the way you defined it."
"1534886042.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","5:14 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Though I always think of covetousness in regards to possessions."
"1534886069.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","5:14 PM","Matt Jardine","Looking it up"
"1534886076.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","5:14 PM","Matt Jardine","it seems like they are basically synonyms"
"1534886087.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","5:14 PM","Matt Jardine","though envy always refers to something somebody else has"
"1534886118.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","5:15 PM","Matt Jardine","whereas covetous is just wanting something regardless of who owns it"
"1534886150.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","5:15 PM","Matt Jardine","glad we figured that out"
"1534886231.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","5:17 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Oh wow! I would’ve thought those were the opposite."
"1534886273.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","5:17 PM","Matt Jardine","i think people only know the word covet from the commandment"
"1534886279.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","5:17 PM","Matt Jardine","and it's used that way there"
"1534886283.000100","Tue Aug 21 2018","5:18 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Exactly."

"1536349023.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:37 PM","Matt Jardine","is there a plot?"
"1536349025.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:37 PM","Matt Jardine","are there characters?"
"1536349033.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:37 PM","Matt Jardine","what sort of things would players have to do?"
"1536349081.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:38 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Like, as the game designer, I would go talk to local businesses and ask if they would officially be involved, and that would just mean that all of their employees know a certain piece of information, so if a player walked in at any time and asked the cashier at JP Licks something, they would get the same piece of information from anyone at JP Licks."
"1536349098.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:38 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Or maybe only one employee knows the information, but every other employee knows who knows that information."
"1536349105.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:38 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Like, “You’ll have to ask Maria.”"
"1536349116.000200","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:38 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And Maria only works on Thursdays between 2 and 6."
"1536349125.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:38 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So you just have to come back then."
"1536349145.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:39 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So like, anyone who is regularly in Davis becomes a non-player character."
"1536349166.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:39 PM","Matt Jardine","ooh cool"
"1536349210.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:40 PM","Matt Jardine","!!!"
"1536349212.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:40 PM","Matt Jardine","I want to help"
"1536349219.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:40 PM","Matt Jardine","this is a v good idea"
"1536349220.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:40 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Hey cool."
"1536349260.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:41 PM","Matt Jardine","ohh you should try to recruit Liz as a puzzle designer"
"1536349267.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:41 PM","Matt Jardine","she seems busy a lot of the time though"
"1536349292.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:41 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","YES."
"1536349321.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:42 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So, I’m trying to think about what makes this different (in my mind) from a puzzle hunt."
"1536349344.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:42 PM","Matt Jardine","the fact that you have characters"
"1536349347.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:42 PM","Matt Jardine","and maybe a story"
"1536349349.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:42 PM","Matt Jardine","is cool"
"1536349357.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:42 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And I think it’s the role of non-player-characters and actually having to talk to Davis people to find out things that actually involve Davis, etc."
"1536349366.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:42 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","(It could be broadened, probably.)"
"1536349374.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:42 PM","Matt Jardine","Davis is a good thought"
"1536349382.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:43 PM","Matt Jardine","you could like, bury something in that little park behind the T"
"1536349389.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:43 PM","Matt Jardine","for people to find"
"1536349391.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:43 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Hehe, yeah!"
"1536349416.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:43 PM","Matt Jardine","I suggest something like a reptilian invasion as the plot"
"1536349418.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:43 PM","Matt Jardine","if there is a plot"
"1536349419.000200","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:43 PM","Matt Jardine","<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptilians>"
"1536349431.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:43 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Ha!"
"1536349446.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:44 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So attainable."
"1536349453.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:44 PM","Matt Jardine","so like half of the davis business owners could maybe be replaced by reptilian shapeshifters"
"1536349463.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:44 PM","Matt Jardine","good guys and bad guys"
"1536349469.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:44 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott",":joy:"
"1536349480.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:44 PM","Matt Jardine","you have to save the town!"
"1536349492.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:44 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Okay you should start a file somewhere where you keep notes as ideas come to you."
"1536349537.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:45 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Oh and if that is the plot you _definitely_ at some point have to do research on these things at ComicaZi."
"1536349552.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:45 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Or get some gadget there or something."
"1536349553.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:45 PM","Matt Jardine","yeah?"
"1536349562.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:46 PM","Matt Jardine","oh I see 'you' being the player"
"1536349568.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:46 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yes, sorry."
"1536349612.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:46 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I don’t know why but I really like the idea of this taking a long time."
"1536349620.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:47 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Like, you have to use the mail sometimes."
"1536349625.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:47 PM","Matt Jardine","that's a good idea!"
"1536349635.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:47 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And then just wait for things to get sent back to you."
"1536349637.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:47 PM","Matt Jardine","I agree, it makes it feel more lifelike"
"1536349661.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:47 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Okay I should do work but I somehow can’t stop thinking about this."
"1536349668.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:47 PM","Matt Jardine","start a notion thing"
"1536349678.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:47 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott",":scream: Do you have Notion now?"
"1536349689.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:48 PM","Matt Jardine","no but if you make something and invite me to edit it I can, right?"
"1536350048.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:54 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Actually no. :white_frowning_face:"
"1536350055.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:54 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","You have to have an account to edit anything in Notion."
"1536350069.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:54 PM","Matt Jardine","oh"
"1536350084.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:54 PM","Matt Jardine","do accounts cost money?"
"1536350090.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:54 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Nope."
"1536350112.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:55 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Not until you reach some limit, then it’s $4 a month or something."
"1536350116.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:55 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But that limit seems far away."
"1536350233.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:57 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Oh shoot."
"1536350244.000200","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:57 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But I can’t share with edit permissions unless I’m paying the $4."
"1536350246.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:57 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Hm."
"1536350264.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:57 PM","Matt Jardine","yeah"
"1536350294.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:58 PM","Matt Jardine","if the point of the platform is easy collaboration, I think Google docs is the way to go"
"1536350303.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:58 PM","Matt Jardine","everyone already has a google account"
"1536350329.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:58 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I mean, it’s super easy if everyone’s paying. :sweat_smile:"
"1536350341.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:59 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","If Ivan makes the document we can both edit for free."
"1536350346.000200","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:59 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","(Because he’s paying.)"
"1536350357.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:59 PM","Matt Jardine","`everyone already has a google account`"
"1536350363.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:59 PM","Matt Jardine","is like my main point"
"1536350380.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:59 PM","Matt Jardine","if you are already an organization like a company or something, then fire"
"1536350382.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:59 PM","Matt Jardine","fine*"
"1536350385.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","3:59 PM","Matt Jardine","I bet notion is great"
"1536351391.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","4:16 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Okay but just make a Notion account anyway :sweat_smile:"
"1536351409.000200","Fri Sep 07 2018","4:16 PM","Matt Jardine","ok"

"1536351467.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","4:17 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I was wrong about the not being able to share with edit permissions without upgrading."
"1536351522.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","4:18 PM","Matt Jardine","apparently i already have an acct"
"1536351531.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","4:18 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Hehe, sweet!"

"1536356133.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","5:35 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I know!"
"1536356296.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","5:38 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Ivan says you can’t stop by. Which is what I was just confirming. Sorry."
"1536356325.000100","Fri Sep 07 2018","5:38 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But he said it with :weary: face which means he’s sad about it."

"1536586179.000100","Mon Sep 10 2018","9:29 AM","Matt Jardine","actually yeah, I had to take benadryl"
"1536586185.000200","Mon Sep 10 2018","9:29 AM","Matt Jardine","so I fell asleep at like 9 last night"
"1536586307.000100","Mon Sep 10 2018","9:31 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Oh what! Are you allergic?"
"1536586317.000100","Mon Sep 10 2018","9:31 AM","Matt Jardine","yeah, but not seriously"
"1536586337.000100","Mon Sep 10 2018","9:32 AM","Matt Jardine","two of the cats are long hairs, so it was extra bad"

"1536586537.000100","Mon Sep 10 2018","9:35 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I was sympathizing."
"1536586547.000100","Mon Sep 10 2018","9:35 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But he left at ~4am yesterday for Michigan."

"1536586625.000100","Mon Sep 10 2018","9:37 AM","Matt Jardine","what sort of so much?"
"1536586675.000100","Mon Sep 10 2018","9:37 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Mostly chore-y stuff."
"1536586707.000200","Mon Sep 10 2018","9:38 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","There was a bunch of money stuff we needed to sort out. I had been ignoring a scary pile of medical bills that I finally confronted yesterday."
"1536586718.000100","Mon Sep 10 2018","9:38 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Also, our dental insurance kind of sucks!"
"1536586720.000100","Mon Sep 10 2018","9:38 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Maybe."
"1536586725.000100","Mon Sep 10 2018","9:38 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I don’t know, actually, how it compares."
"1536586764.000100","Mon Sep 10 2018","9:39 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But Ivan and I went to the dentist Thursday and both have to go back for fillings, etc., and it will cost us a small fortune!"
"1536586771.000100","Mon Sep 10 2018","9:39 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So I was trying to budget/plan for that."

"1536940695.000100","Fri Sep 14 2018","11:58 AM","Matt Jardine","so text looks real good"
"1536940703.000100","Fri Sep 14 2018","11:58 AM","Matt Jardine","(kind of like it looks on the macbook's display)"
"1536940709.000100","Fri Sep 14 2018","11:58 AM","Matt Jardine","also they are matte instead of glossy"
"1536940725.000100","Fri Sep 14 2018","11:58 AM","Matt Jardine","so there is no glare"

"1536941334.000100","Fri Sep 14 2018","12:08 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But I don’t think you have to be into yourself to subconsciously want to appear in such a way that _doesn’t_ make an ex think “GEE I’m glad I got out of that” from taking a look at you."
"1536941375.000100","Fri Sep 14 2018","12:09 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So by asking about it I wasn’t thinking you might be particularly vain, I was thinking you might be human."
"1536941405.000100","Fri Sep 14 2018","12:10 PM","Matt Jardine","but like I want the opposite thing"
"1536941432.000100","Fri Sep 14 2018","12:10 PM","Matt Jardine","I want her to be completely over it and moved on and whatnot"

"1536941787.000100","Fri Sep 14 2018","12:16 PM","Matt Jardine","I do care about how people think I look, just not her"
"1536941810.000100","Fri Sep 14 2018","12:16 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But I mean you don’t have that thing everyone else has where they’re like “Oh, I’m going to see someone I was involved with once? Better look fly.” Or at least not yet. Maybe that only kicks in after a few years of separation."
"1536941820.000100","Fri Sep 14 2018","12:17 PM","Matt Jardine","yeah maybe"
"1536941825.000100","Fri Sep 14 2018","12:17 PM","Matt Jardine","I think if _she_ left _me_"
"1536941829.000100","Fri Sep 14 2018","12:17 PM","Matt Jardine","i would totally feel that way"

"1537559409.000100","Fri Sep 21 2018","3:50 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I think that means it’s a _really_ good game."

"1537559426.000100","Fri Sep 21 2018","3:50 PM","Matt Jardine","ooh New solo AI Hank the Leech. Co-op mode against Mint Corp AI includes a special AI only location and rules for co-op play."

"1537559449.000100","Fri Sep 21 2018","3:50 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Oh. But probably this will have the universal co-op game problem."
"1537559529.000100","Fri Sep 21 2018","3:52 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","It is $5 so I bought it."

"1537559656.000100","Fri Sep 21 2018","3:54 PM","Matt Jardine","i mean, sometimes the mechanics of a game fix the universal coop problem"

"1537559662.000100","Fri Sep 21 2018","3:54 PM","Matt Jardine","maybe this will work too"
"1537559674.000100","Fri Sep 21 2018","3:54 PM","Matt Jardine","also if you disagree what should be done, coop games work"
"1537559679.000100","Fri Sep 21 2018","3:54 PM","Matt Jardine","but maybe are just frustrating"

"1538162378.000200","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:19 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yeah, so I’m just figuring out October only."

"1538162489.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:21 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Hehe, 7."
"1538162489.000200","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:21 PM","Matt Jardine","is it at 7?"
"1538162491.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:21 PM","Matt Jardine","yeah"
"1538162495.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:21 PM","Matt Jardine","that is not going to work"
"1538162507.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:21 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Hehe, why not?"
"1538162519.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:21 PM","Matt Jardine","sometimes we don't even get to the gym until 6"
"1538162520.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:22 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","High intensity interval climbing!"

"1538162532.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:22 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","_Yeah,_ but I mean, we would if we had to."
"1538162553.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:22 PM","Matt Jardine","you'd have to be packing up to leave around 6:30"
"1538162562.000200","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:22 PM","Matt Jardine","that would be pretty absurd"
"1538162570.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:22 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Mmmmm—6:40."
"1538162580.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:23 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And we could leave work a _little_ early."
"1538162589.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:23 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Or Mondays!"
"1538162605.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:23 PM","Matt Jardine","I dont want to try having two standing things in a row on mondays"
"1538162608.000200","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:23 PM","Matt Jardine","sorry"
"1538162613.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:23 PM","Matt Jardine","plus there is like eating and stuff"
"1538162616.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:23 PM","Matt Jardine","in between"
"1538162637.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:23 PM","Matt Jardine","you are doing boxing on tuesdays, yeah?"
"1538162647.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:24 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Oh that’s funny. I was kind of happy to bundle the standing things so I would still have open days."
"1538162661.000200","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:24 PM","Matt Jardine","it sound stressful, and like both things would suffer"
"1538162662.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:24 PM","Matt Jardine","to me"
"1538162665.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:24 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yes, boxing tuesdays."
"1538162753.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:25 PM","Matt Jardine","i'd rather do a short version of www:te on thursdays"
"1538162758.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:25 PM","Matt Jardine","than try to move climbing"
"1538162761.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:26 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Oh!"
"1538162765.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:26 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","That works too."
"1538162787.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:26 PM","Matt Jardine","there is less set setup and cooldown needed for that"
"1538162790.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:26 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","That’s cuz you want to climb longer?"
"1538162792.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:26 PM","Matt Jardine","plus it doesn't leave you hungry"
"1538162800.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:26 PM","Matt Jardine","and also yes"
"1538162812.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:26 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Because if we climbed Thursdays, you can keep climbing after I leave."
"1538162887.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:28 PM","Matt Jardine","I think you will find that like half an hour of climbing is not adequate and you'll just stop"
"1538162919.000200","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:28 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","You don’t think we could get an hour+ in?"
"1538162934.000200","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:28 PM","Matt Jardine","if you are trying to be somewher _at_ 7?"
"1538162936.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:28 PM","Matt Jardine","definitely not"
"1538162949.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:29 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Oh. The somewhere is right here in Davis."
"1538162964.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:29 PM","Matt Jardine","yeah so I think trying to do work night + that is a more reasonable pairing"
"1538162965.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:29 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So I would just go straight there."
"1538162982.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:29 PM","Matt Jardine","like if both things are in davis you should do both of those things on the same night"
"1538162987.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:29 PM","Matt Jardine","plus you dont have to change"
"1538162995.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:29 PM","Matt Jardine","I think I'm sticking to wednesdays"
"1538163012.000200","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:30 PM","Matt Jardine","it kind of fits my schedule better anyway"
"1538163039.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:30 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Hmph."
"1538163066.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:31 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Okay!"
"1538163102.000200","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:31 PM","Matt Jardine","I mean last time we went climbing you got home at what, like 10:30?"
"1538163111.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:31 PM","Matt Jardine","and we weren't trying to do something else afterward"
"1538163117.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:31 PM","Matt Jardine","I think trying to rush it is doomed to failure"
"1538163130.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:32 PM","Matt Jardine","and it makes less sense than the alternative"
"1538163134.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:32 PM","Matt Jardine","that's my opinion anyway"
"1538163139.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:32 PM","Matt Jardine","it's your schedule!"
"1538163150.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:32 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yeah. Guess I’ll climb with you in November then. :wave:"
"1538163172.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:32 PM","Matt Jardine","Why don't you come on wednesdays and have work nights on thursday?"
"1538163178.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:32 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I don’t wanna."
"1538163182.000200","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:33 PM","Matt Jardine","haha ok"
"1538163188.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:33 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Hehe just kidding!"
"1538163200.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:33 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I’ll consider it."
"1538163208.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:33 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","It does make sense."
"1538163236.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:33 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I’m trying to figure out why I have a preference for climbing Thursdays (or Mondays) over Wednesdays."
"1538163262.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:34 PM","Matt Jardine","maybe you want the alliteration back"
"1538163963.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:46 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I think I like Wednesday/Thursday nights that you’ve been able to linger at our apartment."
"1538163992.000200","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:46 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I definitely also like the lingering on climbing nights—"
"1538163994.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:46 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","like the last one—"
"1538164017.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:46 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","but if Ivan’s not around for those then I get into thinking about _cost_, as we discussed."
"1538164041.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:47 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Like, I’m less likely to climb-linger on Wednesdays in October."
"1538164162.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:49 PM","Matt Jardine","that makes sense"
"1538164227.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:50 PM","Matt Jardine","¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
"1538164231.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:50 PM","Matt Jardine","I dunno what to tell you"
"1538164257.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:50 PM","Matt Jardine","there aren't all that many days in a week"
"1538164313.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:51 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Ha, really? I don’t think I articulated that well at all!"
"1538164371.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:52 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I’m just tryna get more time with you but you’re dead set against it. :wink:"
"1538164382.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:53 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I think the _Monday_ plan is the best, by the way."
"1538164387.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:53 PM","Matt Jardine","you are trying to box and do church stuff and see your husband and start a company"
"1538164398.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:53 PM","Matt Jardine","monday is literally the one day of the week I really can't :stuck_out_tongue:"
"1538164501.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:55 PM","Matt Jardine","well"
"1538164501.000300","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:55 PM","Matt Jardine","eh"
"1538164503.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:55 PM","Matt Jardine","maybe"
"1538164511.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:55 PM","Matt Jardine","I might do monday + wednesday :stuck_out_tongue:"
"1538164515.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:55 PM","Matt Jardine","I can't do www"
"1538164550.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:55 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","No no no no no."
"1538164598.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:56 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","That defeats the purpose!"
"1538164610.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:56 PM","Matt Jardine","climbing is sort of important to me"
"1538164621.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:57 PM","Matt Jardine","I'm not going to try to rush it"
"1538164630.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:57 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But you don’t have to rush it if you go on Thursdays!"
"1538164647.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:57 PM","Matt Jardine","I'd rather not see my ex"
"1538164651.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:57 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Oh."
"1538164678.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:57 PM","Matt Jardine","I guess it wouldn't be the end of the world"
"1538164690.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:58 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I didn’t remember when she climbed."
"1538164691.000200","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:58 PM","Matt Jardine","but that kind of screws up the thing where sometimes I go on fridays"
"1538164706.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:58 PM","Matt Jardine","like I'm trying to go a few times a week"
"1538164707.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:58 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Or if she will still climb then given the new schedule."
"1538164713.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:58 PM","Matt Jardine","and I am away on the weekends so often lately"
"1538164730.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:58 PM","Matt Jardine","wednesday being in the middle of the week makes it most likely that i'll get 2 days in"
"1538164778.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","3:59 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","_Or_ climb Tuesdays while your ex is occupied punching things!"

"1538164882.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","4:01 PM","Matt Jardine","yeah I have to get going"

"1538166637.000200","Fri Sep 28 2018","4:30 PM","Matt Jardine","What about breakfasts?"
"1538166643.000200","Fri Sep 28 2018","4:30 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","You said once you would come to breakfasts maybe?"
"1538166649.000100","Fri Sep 28 2018","4:30 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","If we did them before work?"

"1539100188.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:49 AM","Matt Jardine","Well, hanging around NF would probably have been boring for everyone"
"1539100201.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:50 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","but I thought that."
"1539100204.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:50 AM","Matt Jardine","well, besides the pizza and cookies"
"1539100206.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:50 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Well, we just took naps at home anyway!"
"1539100211.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:50 AM","Matt Jardine","ah"
"1539100224.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:50 AM","Matt Jardine","Sleepy day"
"1539100238.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:50 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And did that terrible, terrible thing where you spend an hour just kind of sitting distractedly trying to figure out what to do."
"1539100247.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:50 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And, like, just sitting would’ve been fine!"

"1539100259.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:50 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yep."
"1539100283.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:51 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Anyway, I felt like extremely bad about that."

"1539100304.000200","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:51 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yeah, perhaps slightly unreasonably."
"1539100318.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:51 AM","Matt Jardine","I'm sorry I didn't see more of you guys this weekend"
"1539100326.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:52 AM","Matt Jardine","it seemed kind of like a big weekend for y'all"
"1539100403.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:53 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But I think in all TV shows where there’s a chummy group of friends, your character would not have been abandoned like our characters did."
"1539100433.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:53 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And somehow the comparison to TV shows really did trigger this guilt."
"1539100438.000200","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:53 AM","Matt Jardine","have you every seen It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia?"
"1539100441.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:54 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Nope."
"1539100448.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:54 AM","Matt Jardine","They would have definitely abandoned me"
"1539100451.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:54 AM","Matt Jardine","in that show"
"1539100453.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:54 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Haha."
"1539100470.000200","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:54 AM","Matt Jardine","I mean, I was working"
"1539100491.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:54 AM","Matt Jardine","there was no expectation that you guys would have stuck around"
"1539100495.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:54 AM","Matt Jardine","plus you are entertaining guests"
"1539100499.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:54 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yeah, but I think this maybe was triggered by some recent episodes of _The Office_ where the characters really come through for each other, and they don’t even _like_ each other."
"1539100512.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:55 AM","Matt Jardine","Oh interesting"
"1539100534.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:55 AM","Matt Jardine","the office is pretty unrealistic"
"1539100541.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:55 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Anyway, sorry I didn’t have the charisma to rally everyone to stay, and/or wasn’t willing to pay what it cost to say without them."
"1539100550.000200","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:55 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Haha, of course."
"1539100552.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:55 AM","Matt Jardine","you jerk"
"1539100562.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:56 AM","Matt Jardine","what did you do on sunday"
"1539100563.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:56 AM","Matt Jardine","?"
"1539100575.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:56 AM","Matt Jardine","also what are you doing tomorrow?"
"1539100622.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:57 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Well I think the most significant part of the weekend was that we watched _Get Out_ on Saturday night."
"1539100658.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:57 AM","Matt Jardine","oh that's a good one"
"1539100671.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:57 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","_Yes._"
"1539100685.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:58 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","We were embarrassed at having not seen it earlier."
"1539100699.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:58 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But then no one would watch it with us because we hadn’t seen it earlier, so it was kind of a self-perpetuating loop."
"1539100702.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:58 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But Steve hadn’t seen it."
"1539100705.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:58 AM","Matt Jardine","haha"
"1539100710.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:58 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Norton had, but he just watched us watch it."
"1539100731.000200","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:58 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","It was very good and terrifying, and I had nightmares all night."
"1539100733.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:58 AM","Matt Jardine","I love the scene where the girl is eating fruit loops one at a time"
"1539100757.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:59 AM","Matt Jardine","eek, what sort of nightmares?"
"1539100786.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:59 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","That people were being brainwashed/mind-controlled, and it was my fault."
"1539100787.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:59 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott",":joy:"
"1539100794.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","11:59 AM","Matt Jardine","haha"
"1539100802.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","12:00 PM","Matt Jardine","off white guilt"
"1539100806.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","12:00 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Which, I think, is exactly the desired outcome of the film."
"1539100872.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","12:01 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Sunday we sat in a park and talked about Salvador, then Malika came over in the evening and we made a ton of pesto with Noteflight basil and ate pasta and then played “Someone Has Died.”"
"1539100890.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","12:01 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Monday we hung out at the gym all day and work-climbed then played Secret Hitler in the evening."
"1539100893.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","12:01 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And that was the weekend."
"1539100919.000100","Tue Oct 09 2018","12:01 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I am very chatty at the moment because I am waiting for a staging environment to wake up. I will not pester you all day."

"1539203599.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","4:33 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
"1539203647.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","4:34 PM","Matt Jardine","I think the original is better than the remixes, IMO"
"1539203659.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","4:34 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I think I think that too."
"1539203686.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","4:34 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I am stuck on my card."
"1539203691.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","4:34 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Blocked, rather."

"1539203708.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","4:35 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But I am restless."

"1539203822.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","4:37 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","That used to be my corner. :cry:"

"1539204679.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","4:51 PM","Matt Jardine","it's kinda cheesy"
"1539204683.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","4:51 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","It does seem out of character, but are you so committed to your persona?"
"1539204686.000200","Wed Oct 10 2018","4:51 PM","Matt Jardine","and old, but not in a classy way"
"1539204706.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","4:51 PM","Matt Jardine","I don't think it's terribly out of character, is it?"
"1539204715.000200","Wed Oct 10 2018","4:51 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Just the style."

"1539204874.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","4:54 PM","Matt Jardine","ohh"
"1539204889.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","4:54 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I recommended that he/they come work in the room that you don’t need a pass for—"
"1539204891.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","4:54 PM","Matt Jardine","hm"
"1539204900.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","4:55 PM","Matt Jardine","that room isn't that nice"
"1539204910.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","4:55 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","but I guess there’s not really a point unless we know we’re doing something after."
"1539204911.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","4:55 PM","Matt Jardine","and it's not like we'd be spending a lot of time with them"
"1539204936.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","4:55 PM","Matt Jardine","I'm trying to think if there's a better way to schedule these two evenings"
"1539204999.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","4:56 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Cuz you have to take a _whole evening_ to pack, right?"
"1539205012.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","4:56 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I just pack 20 minutes before I go anywhere."
"1539205017.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","4:56 PM","Matt Jardine","well"
"1539205043.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","4:57 PM","Matt Jardine","i felt like packing could encompass laundry and planning and decompressing and stuff"
"1539205047.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","4:57 PM","Matt Jardine","for the sake of conversation"
"1539205063.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","4:57 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Hehe, true."
"1539205074.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","4:57 PM","Matt Jardine","plus there is still a monitor laying where it fell on my bedroom floor"

"1539205112.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","4:58 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But we could just not stay out super late, then you could also do those other things tonight."
"1539205123.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","4:58 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Tomorrow night we might try to go to the Museum of Modern Renaissance again with a crowd."
"1539205141.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","4:59 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","“A crowd” being whatever the minimum number of people is you need to schedule a tour."
"1539205153.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","4:59 PM","Matt Jardine","it's a lot of people, right?"
"1539205157.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","4:59 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Eh. 10?"
"1539205164.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","4:59 PM","Matt Jardine","10 is a lot to me :stuck_out_tongue:"
"1539205172.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","4:59 PM","Matt Jardine","that's almost our entire company"
"1539205200.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","5:00 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I don’t know if that’s happening anyway."
"1539205200.000300","Wed Oct 10 2018","5:00 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But!"
"1539205219.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","5:00 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I like the idea that you somehow do all the things you have to do tonight _along with_ us climbing."
"1539205228.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","5:00 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Then you can be free to do anything tomorrow! :smile:"
"1539205230.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","5:00 PM","Matt Jardine","Uhh, sorry?"
"1539205236.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","5:00 PM","Matt Jardine","haha I need a night"
"1539205306.000200","Wed Oct 10 2018","5:01 PM","Matt Jardine","I haven't had any appreciable chunk of time to myself at home since... Thursday I think?"
"1539205312.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","5:01 PM","Matt Jardine","what did I do thursday..."
"1539205344.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","5:02 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Hehe, probably hung out with us."
"1539205373.000200","Wed Oct 10 2018","5:02 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So since before then."
"1539205375.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","5:02 PM","Matt Jardine","no, it looks like there was a tst meeting"
"1539205401.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","5:03 PM","Matt Jardine","so I was probably here at work until like 9"
"1539205414.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","5:03 PM","Matt Jardine","i was at your place m/w/f last week I think"
"1539205419.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","5:03 PM","Matt Jardine","at jill's tuesday"
"1539205429.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","5:03 PM","Matt Jardine","so maybe since _last_ weekend then"

"1539205486.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","5:04 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Me too."
"1539205490.000200","Wed Oct 10 2018","5:04 PM","Matt Jardine","cool"

"1539205603.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","5:06 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I could try hard at recruiting the others if we knew we wanted to eat out or something after."
"1539205619.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","5:06 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Do you think you’d be up for that?"
"1539205694.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","5:08 PM","Matt Jardine","Yeah why not"
"1539205699.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","5:08 PM","Matt Jardine","we could even meet them somewhere after"
"1539205702.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","5:08 PM","Matt Jardine","that might make more sense"
"1539205710.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","5:08 PM","Matt Jardine","so they don't have to mill around at the gym"
"1539205743.000100","Wed Oct 10 2018","5:09 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott",":ok_hand:"
"1539267021.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","10:10 AM","Matt Jardine","i didnt bring a jacket and people are going to be using the conference room all day"

"1539267861.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","10:24 AM","Matt Jardine","because I rented the car, I guess"
"1539267881.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","10:24 AM","Matt Jardine","nobody else was stepping up"
"1539267891.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","10:24 AM","Matt Jardine","they will help me drive though"
"1539267956.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","10:25 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","What are you nervous about?"
"1539267967.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","10:26 AM","Matt Jardine","I'm worried about crashing"

"1539267987.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","10:26 AM","Matt Jardine","plus they interfere with alcohol"
"1539268081.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","10:28 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Ha, being worried about being scared is real. I think a lot of my night time fears are about being terrified that _someone will scare me_."
"1539268095.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","10:28 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Can you get more panic drugs?"

"1539268232.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","10:30 AM","Matt Jardine","yeah"
"1539268244.000200","Thu Oct 11 2018","10:30 AM","Matt Jardine","driving might actually be better because I need to concentrate on something"
"1539268292.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","10:31 AM","Matt Jardine","I also worry about the social unacceptability of panicking over (apparently) nothing"
"1539268296.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","10:31 AM","Matt Jardine","which makes it worse"
"1539268371.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","10:32 AM","Matt Jardine","what does your weekend look like?"
"1539269227.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","10:47 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","- Sabbath dinner (which maybe Corrin can’t really come to anymore since we’re moving the time up earlier?), - Malika has a housewarming Saturday night (did she invite you?—she said she was going to, I think, but you’re gone anyway), - David &amp; Becca’s baby shower on Sunday (in Natick! So far away!—also David was thinking of inviting you to this and asked me if I thought you’d want to come and I don’t remember what I said, but also you’re gone anyway), - D&amp;D on Sunday evening."

"1539269248.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","10:47 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Or, at least, a notable thing happening this weekend."

"1539270248.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:04 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Why did she message you about it?"
"1539270280.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:04 AM","Matt Jardine","¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
"1539270287.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:04 AM","Matt Jardine","she just did yesterday"
"1539270336.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:05 AM","Matt Jardine","also I don't think malika even has a way of getting in touch with me"
"1539270394.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:06 AM","Matt Jardine","also I probably would not go to _any_ baby shower, even if I wasn't going away, and even if it wasn't a person I have a rocky relationship with"
"1539270406.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:06 AM","Matt Jardine","like if my brother had a baby shower I probably wouldn't go"
"1539270429.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:07 AM","Matt Jardine","also Norton :cry:"
"1539270980.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:16 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Hehe, I figured about the baby shower. Sometimes it’s just nice to be invited. But then maybe not, because you have to navigate saying no."
"1539271021.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:17 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But if Ivan and I adopt a child someday while we still live near each other and have some sort of party to celebrate it, you’re coming, sorry."
"1539271150.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:19 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Can you comfortably tell me any more of what Corrin said?"

"1539271210.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:20 AM","Matt Jardine","I dunno what is or is not relatable"
"1539271211.000200","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:20 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Well, I can talk to her."
"1539271233.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:20 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But now, I just have this awareness that she is upset that I would not have had before."
"1539271246.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:20 AM","Matt Jardine","like what sort of stuff are you supposed to keep confidential?"
"1539271294.000200","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:21 AM","Matt Jardine","that makes it sound like she said something like 'secret' which I don't think she did"
"1539271311.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:21 AM","Matt Jardine","I just wasn't given explicit permission to represent her, you know?"
"1539271319.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:21 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I don’t know about confidentiality rules, I just think it’s better to talk to people directly than getting info second hand. Getting info second hand is kind of what I’m doing, which is why it feels weird to me."
"1539271329.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:22 AM","Matt Jardine","What is already public knowledge is she usually goes to a class at bkb before sabbath dinner"
"1539271350.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:22 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Can you tell me what gave you the impression that she was upset?"
"1539271358.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:22 AM","Matt Jardine","I think she likes that arrangement, and already paid for the class"
"1539271368.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:22 AM","Matt Jardine","she used the word 'frustrated'"
"1539271381.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:23 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Haha, good sign."
"1539271415.000200","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:23 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And no indication why she texted you?"
"1539271444.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:24 AM","Matt Jardine","sometimes we text cat pictures to each other"
"1539271457.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:24 AM","Matt Jardine","i think she was just venting"
"1539271470.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:24 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yeah, and you are someone who knows about Sabbath Dinner, so that makes sense."
"1539271510.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:25 AM","Matt Jardine","I think she and I share the same grief about you guys slowing down with climbing"
"1539271533.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:25 AM","Matt Jardine","and now her not being able to go to sabbath is like a 1+2 punch"
"1539271579.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:26 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","We have always planned to switch back to 6pm for the fall, but I don’t know if she happened to be around when we were talking very publicly about that."
"1539271597.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:26 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","That doesn’t make it better."
"1539271612.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:26 AM","Matt Jardine","yeah I don't think she thinks you guys are being malicious or anything"
"1539271618.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:26 AM","Matt Jardine","it's just unfortunate?"
"1539271619.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:26 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Haha, cool."
"1539271629.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:27 AM","Matt Jardine","I dunno, corrin sometimes has a hard time telling the difference between those things"
"1539272021.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:33 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Okay. We will try to find some other ways to make sure she feels cared for, see what we can do schedule-wise."
"1539272047.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:34 AM","Matt Jardine","you guys are going to be expert schedulers"
"1539272074.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:34 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I think there could be a somewhat legitimate suspicion of maliciousness in that it is known that we wish you could also come to Sabbath dinner. So scheduling it at a time she can’t come could seem very cold and calculated."
"1539272081.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:34 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","That _definitely_ is not what happened—"
"1539272092.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:34 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But look—"
"1539272161.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:36 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I _did_ somewhat gleefully run over here and mention that “maybe Corrin can’t come to Sabbath dinners for a while” in the hopes that maybe you could, as soon as I figured out that that was an unintentional side effect."
"1539272202.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:36 AM","Matt Jardine","she also mentioned how you don't climb with her anymore"
"1539272210.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:36 AM","Matt Jardine","maybe she is starting to feel squeezed out"
"1539272238.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","11:37 AM","Matt Jardine","I have been sort of feeling that way too, but in my case I know it's mostly my own fault"

"1539287097.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","3:44 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","That would mean I could climb/box with Corrin on Tuesdays, and she could climb Thursdays if she was looking for another day."
"1539287118.000100","Thu Oct 11 2018","3:45 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","That puts me climbing two days in a row, but beggars can’t be choosers."

This came through support:  &gt;&gt;&gt; Dear Noteflight,  My name is Sean; my dream is to make musical software and I am currently in the middle of an immersive web development bootcamp. I’m writing to connect with developers at NoteFlight to learn more about their experience in the industry.  It’s been really inspiring learning about NoteFlight’s innovative notation software with accessibility and community at the heart of your mission. I especially love how at its core NoteFlight is a super easy platform to use, making it easy to extend your functionality and cater to multiple user types.  Would any of your developers be willing to meet with me, either in person or on the phone? If interested, here is a link to my website (<http://www.signalflowsean.com/>) which showcases a number of projects that I have worked on in the past. Hope to hear from you soon. Thanks in advance!

"1541624026.145200","Wed Nov 07 2018","3:53 PM","Matt Jardine","a little bit, but for a different reason"

"1541624090.146800","Wed Nov 07 2018","3:54 PM","Matt Jardine","for instance imagine you ended up paying for this meditation app"
"1541624118.147500","Wed Nov 07 2018","3:55 PM","Matt Jardine","the first app, the life-management one, had a vested interest in getting you to buy that"

"1541624240.151100","Wed Nov 07 2018","3:57 PM","Matt Jardine","Yeah, fair"

"1541624278.152000","Wed Nov 07 2018","3:57 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Or I should broaden mine."
"1541624303.152300","Wed Nov 07 2018","3:58 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But—I am very used to paying for religious content."
"1541624317.152700","Wed Nov 07 2018","3:58 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So even if it fell into that category for me, I probably wouldn’t squirm as much as you seem to be."

"1541624973.156100","Wed Nov 07 2018","4:09 PM","Matt Jardine","These things are probably actually harmless"
"1541624984.156400","Wed Nov 07 2018","4:09 PM","Matt Jardine","like at worst harmless, and very likely actually good"
"1541624996.156700","Wed Nov 07 2018","4:09 PM","Matt Jardine","but I'm talking about principals"
"1541624999.156900","Wed Nov 07 2018","4:09 PM","Matt Jardine","like usual"
"1541625254.159000","Wed Nov 07 2018","4:14 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","In case it makes you feel any better: 1) Fabulous has its own in-app meditation thing that I don’t super care for, or I have used up all those. They didn’t say anything about headspace. 2) One of the authors of Make Time references using Headspace in an anecdote. 3) And then I think I heard it advertised on a podcast somewhere."

"1541625320.160800","Wed Nov 07 2018","4:15 PM","Matt Jardine","yeah that last point is the important one"
"1541625329.161100","Wed Nov 07 2018","4:15 PM","Matt Jardine","like if you are buying a piano or something"
"1541625615.162100","Wed Nov 07 2018","4:20 PM","Matt Jardine","it's pretty unlikely that piano is going to end up causing you to change your behaviors in ways that are negative for you but positive for the piano manufacturer"

"1541626291.166300","Wed Nov 07 2018","4:31 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","You could come say hi to Ivan and maybe Malika."

The Monopoly for Millennials game celebrates just that. Instead of collecting as much cash as possible, players are challenged to rack up the most Experiences to win. Interact with other players via Chance and Community Chest cards, (which are super relatable). And players don’t pay rent -- they visit one another, earning more Experience points. This board game is a great way to bring a fun and relaxed vibe to a party or casual get-together."

"1543948554.021100","Tue Dec 04 2018","1:35 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","the way you’ll know it’s about to happen—"
"1543948570.021500","Tue Dec 04 2018","1:36 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","is that there will be a National Sunday Law."
"1543948571.021700","Tue Dec 04 2018","1:36 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","They say."

"1543948593.022300","Tue Dec 04 2018","1:36 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","In the United States specifically."

"1543948631.023600","Tue Dec 04 2018","1:37 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yep."

"1543949019.028100","Tue Dec 04 2018","1:43 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Also, sometime in the last half of the last century Adventism started trying _really_ hard to blend in with all the rest of the evangelical world, I think because someone called us a cult in some major book."
"1543949075.029800","Tue Dec 04 2018","1:44 PM","Matt Jardine","Do you think there is a wariness around the government and religion partnering too closely in general"
"1543949099.030600","Tue Dec 04 2018","1:44 PM","Matt Jardine","or just a wariness for the government and those sunday observing heretics partnering too closely"
"1543949122.031300","Tue Dec 04 2018","1:45 PM","Matt Jardine","note it wasn't a national Saturday law they were afraid of"
"1543949176.031800","Tue Dec 04 2018","1:46 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And so while Adventism first defined itself in a sort of opposition to other Christian groups in America, most Adventists today probably identify _with_ evangelical Christianity instead of in contrast to or a more nuanced strain of it."
"1543949183.032100","Tue Dec 04 2018","1:46 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Mm, good question."

"1543949281.034200","Tue Dec 04 2018","1:48 PM","Matt Jardine","that's pretty cool"
"1543949315.035000","Tue Dec 04 2018","1:48 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But maybe it’s also always accompanied by the sentiment that we need to defend this for other people because it is also important to us."
"1543949342.035500","Tue Dec 04 2018","1:49 PM","Matt Jardine","right"
"1543949351.036000","Tue Dec 04 2018","1:49 PM","Matt Jardine","adventism is still a minority religion in the states"
"1543949411.037000","Tue Dec 04 2018","1:50 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And unfortunately, the Adventists I know of that think a lot about a potential coming National Sunday law (or this part of our tradition generally) are mostly just super weird conspiracy theorists, counting how many times the President of the US has met with the Pope, etc."

"1545336227.020400","Thu Dec 20 2018","3:03 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","``` ActivityEventStartedFollowingDiscussionFormatter.new(event, @login.current_user, @login.community).render_formatter ```"
"1545336245.020700","Thu Dec 20 2018","3:04 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","~So that formatter calls another formatter inside it.~"
"1545336315.021400","Thu Dec 20 2018","3:05 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Never mind about that part."
"1545336321.021600","Thu Dec 20 2018","3:05 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I want to mock that whole thing."
"1545336340.022000","Thu Dec 20 2018","3:05 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So it just returns `{foo: ""bar""}`"
"1545336400.022400","Thu Dec 20 2018","3:06 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But I’m not sure how to do that when it does the `.new ..... .render_formatter` thing."
"1545336604.023000","Thu Dec 20 2018","3:10 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And by the way, that pattern seems … weird? We just do `SomeFormatterName.format()` in most other cases, I think?"
"1545339230.023200","Thu Dec 20 2018","3:53 PM","Matt Jardine","you can stub any_instance"
"1545339243.023500","Thu Dec 20 2018","3:54 PM","Matt Jardine","so that any instance of the class will have the method stubbed"

"1545339415.025500","Thu Dec 20 2018","3:56 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Wait so how do I write that?"

"1545339439.026400","Thu Dec 20 2018","3:57 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Because two methods are getting called on that class."

"1545415754.001100","Fri Dec 21 2018","1:09 PM","Matt Jardine","Ok I'm prepared"
"1545415827.001600","Fri Dec 21 2018","1:10 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","See a test file like `account_alert_packaging_test.rb`."
"1545415832.001800","Fri Dec 21 2018","1:10 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","What type of test is that?"
"1545415842.002100","Fri Dec 21 2018","1:10 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Are these all minitests? Or rspec?"
"1545415852.002400","Fri Dec 21 2018","1:10 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","You were just converting a bunch of test files from _what_ to _what_?"
"1545415857.002600","Fri Dec 21 2018","1:10 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I could look this up never mind."
"1545415869.003000","Fri Dec 21 2018","1:11 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I just thought to phrase the question this way."
"1545415893.003500","Fri Dec 21 2018","1:11 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But basically I need to figure out how to mock a method from a module but I don’t know what testing framework we’re using."
"1545415917.003800","Fri Dec 21 2018","1:11 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","You just killed rspec so everything is minitest now?"
"1545415968.004000","Fri Dec 21 2018","1:12 PM","Matt Jardine","Yep"
"1545415979.004400","Fri Dec 21 2018","1:12 PM","Matt Jardine","No more rspec"
"1545416008.005200","Fri Dec 21 2018","1:13 PM","Matt Jardine","We only had a few rspec tests. you probably haven't encountered rspec."
"1545416017.005600","Fri Dec 21 2018","1:13 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Cool cool."
"1545416025.006200","Fri Dec 21 2018","1:13 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But we use this `context` `should` syntax."
"1545416035.006600","Fri Dec 21 2018","1:13 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Where do we get that from?"
"1545416052.007000","Fri Dec 21 2018","1:14 PM","Matt Jardine","I understand why you ask though, rspec is popular so it confuses Google results"
"1545416081.007700","Fri Dec 21 2018","1:14 PM","Matt Jardine","Uh, I think newer versions of minitest support that syntax"
"1545416112.008800","Fri Dec 21 2018","1:15 PM","Matt Jardine","I suppose we could be using a gem for that"
"1545416115.008900","Fri Dec 21 2018","1:15 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Okay so for my specific question, see `site/app/controllers/concerns/activity_event_packaging.rb`."
"1545416148.009600","Fri Dec 21 2018","1:15 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","The first method—`package_activity_events`—calls the second method—`package_activity_events_list`."

"1546457897.007600","Wed Jan 02 2019","2:38 PM","Matt Jardine","especially because it would make it look _so_ much nicer"
"1546457916.008000","Wed Jan 02 2019","2:38 PM","Matt Jardine","but it has to do with layering sprites and the map editor in pico"
"1546457979.009000","Wed Jan 02 2019","2:39 PM","Matt Jardine","in order to have walls and cubical walls in the same tile the interior cubical walls would have to be created programmatically, wheras right now you can use the built in map maker"

"1546458098.012800","Wed Jan 02 2019","2:41 PM","Matt Jardine","I think that's inevitable though because building and destroying walls is going to be a big part of the game (or maybe not?)"

I have texted a message to you and Ivan that doesn’t seem to be going through because my phone is dead, but it may still come through later, so sorry for the redundant info:  Matt, Ivan and I didn’t eat breakfast and want to eat our traditional breakfast for lunch. Do you want to come over?"

"1546965137.020500","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:32 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I have a work-related question:"

"1546965187.021900","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:33 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Is it okay for me to install and run it locally? I wouldn’t push it."
"1546965190.022100","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:33 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But I more mean—"
"1546965213.022700","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:33 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Is there any approval process/caution for what random gems we’re running against our code?"
"1546965247.023000","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:34 AM","Matt Jardine","I would probably just run it"
"1546965250.023200","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:34 AM","Matt Jardine","good instinct though"
"1546965302.024100","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:35 AM","Matt Jardine","I suppose it could be secretly installing a keylogger or something, but it's been starred 663 times, so it's probably legit"

"1546965335.024800","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:35 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I am very ready to climb tonight."
"1546965355.025300","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:35 AM","Matt Jardine","Me too"
"1546965359.025600","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:35 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But also, I am trying to be home at 9 so I can finish my first assignment for class!"

"1546965368.026100","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:36 AM","Matt Jardine","oh!"
"1546965372.026400","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:36 AM","Matt Jardine","no dinner I suppose"
"1546965381.026600","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:36 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I am telling you because they say telling your friends your goals improves the likelihood of them happening."
"1546965393.027200","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:36 AM","Matt Jardine","I have experienced the opposite of this"
"1546965407.027800","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:36 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I think dinner is still possible if we climb from ~5:30 - 7:30, eat 7:30 – 8:45."
"1546965414.028200","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:36 AM","Matt Jardine","Sometimes telling people my plans gives me enough social validation that i'm no longer motivated to follow through"
"1546965419.028400","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:36 AM","Matt Jardine","and by sometimes I mean often"
"1546965438.028900","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:37 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Haha, well, maybe letting your friends know ahead of time when you’re trying to leave is slightly different."
"1546965449.029100","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:37 AM","Matt Jardine","Yes"
"1546965472.029900","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:37 AM","Matt Jardine","true"
"1546965504.030300","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:38 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Anyway, I still think dinner is possible if I’m mindful of the time."
"1546965522.030500","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:38 AM","Matt Jardine","What is your first assignment?"
"1546965591.031800","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:39 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Introduce yourself to the class and then write a personal statement that is basically about what you think the concepts of “shalom” and the church’s “witness” mean, your current perspective/understanding of them."
"1546965601.032100","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:40 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Our final assignment will be to revise this statement."
"1546965632.032800","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:40 AM","Matt Jardine","In my highschool gym class, we were graded like that"
"1546965648.033200","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:40 AM","Matt Jardine","you took a fitness test at the beginning of the year, and then at the end"
"1546965657.033600","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:40 AM","Matt Jardine","and you were graded on how much you improved"
"1546965673.034200","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:41 AM","Matt Jardine","a lot of kids just purposefully did awful at the beginning"
"1546965679.034600","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:41 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Haha, I don’t know that this is so much about “improvement” …"
"1546965689.034900","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:41 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yeah, same for me with gym class."
"1546965693.035100","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:41 AM","Matt Jardine","no, trust me. just write a really terrible essay tonight"
"1546965723.035700","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:42 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Well, this essay is worth 10% of our grade, so that’s a bit risky."
"1546965736.035900","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:42 AM","Matt Jardine","Oh, hmm."
"1546965755.036500","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:42 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I like this!"
"1546965764.036800","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:42 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Ivan’s told you about the book “Make It Stick”?"
"1546965769.037000","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:42 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","He and Remi are reading it, I guess?"
"1546965772.037300","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:42 AM","Matt Jardine","Probably"
"1546965777.037400","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:42 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","It’s all about how to learn and stuff."
"1546965788.037800","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:43 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","One of the things they suggest is called “generation” or something like that."
"1546965815.038500","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:43 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","The concept is that if you try to answer a question / solve a problem before you’re taught how to, you’ll learn the material better when you do go through it."
"1546965822.038800","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:43 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So I think this is a great first assignment."
"1546965830.039100","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:43 AM","Matt Jardine","That makes sense"
"1546965850.039500","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:44 AM","Matt Jardine","I find that to be true with programming and work and stuff"
"1546965854.039700","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:44 AM","Matt Jardine","also math"
"1546965871.040400","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:44 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Ya"
"1546965884.040700","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:44 AM","Matt Jardine","you don't really know what your tools/formulas are doing unless you've faced the problem without them"
"1546965902.041000","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:45 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Right! Like Redux!"
"1546965926.041400","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:45 AM","Matt Jardine","I'm really distrustful of self help type stuff and I can't put my finger on why"
"1546965964.041800","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:46 AM","Matt Jardine","Same with apps"
"1546965978.042300","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:46 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Cuz most of it is incredibly cheesy!"
"1546965979.042400","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:46 AM","Matt Jardine","I feel like I need to write this down"
"1546965987.042700","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:46 AM","Matt Jardine","yeah It's cheesy and unscientific"
"1546965995.043200","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:46 AM","Matt Jardine","(usually)"
"1546966014.043900","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:46 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Are you saying that about Make it Stick? I don’t know that it would be categorized as self-help …"
"1546966020.044100","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:47 AM","Matt Jardine","It often reminds me of people who come to revelations from taking hallucinogens"
"1546966069.045300","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:47 AM","Matt Jardine","like yeah, you can learn things about yourself from books and drugs, but you could probably figure those things out with just a little self relfection"
"1546966072.045600","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:47 AM","Matt Jardine","and it would be more genuine"
"1546966083.046000","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:48 AM","Matt Jardine","I think that's similar to this ""generation"" thing"
"1546966091.046100","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:48 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Oh wups: [image.png](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T03ERF17M-FF905P3TN/download/image.png)"
"1546966125.046700","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:48 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","It has been classified as “Self  Help” by 106 readers."
"1546966171.047300","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:49 AM","Matt Jardine","yeah, it's not like a medical journal :stuck_out_tongue:"
"1546966205.047700","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:50 AM","Matt Jardine","Self help books are also usually really reductionist"
"1546966222.048100","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:50 AM","Matt Jardine","like they assume people generally have the same minds"
"1546966262.048600","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:51 AM","Matt Jardine","or people fit into a few distinct categories"
"1546966556.048800","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:55 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","This is true."
"1546966575.049200","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:56 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I often _do_ find myself in those categories, though."
"1546966593.049800","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:56 AM","Matt Jardine","yeah true"
"1546966602.050200","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:56 AM","Matt Jardine","maybe I just don't like thinking about myself that way"
"1546966604.050300","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:56 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Or, sometimes even incredibly reductionist things help give me language to figure out other things about myself."
"1546966611.050500","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:56 AM","Matt Jardine","yeah"
"1546966649.050900","Tue Jan 08 2019","11:57 AM","Matt Jardine","that is true"

"1547570371.029400","Tue Jan 15 2019","11:39 AM","Matt Jardine","I feel like I sort of saw this coming"
"1547570377.029600","Tue Jan 15 2019","11:39 AM","Matt Jardine","it's going to be harder to see you guys"
"1547570382.030000","Tue Jan 15 2019","11:39 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Shut up."
"1547570390.030200","Tue Jan 15 2019","11:39 AM","Matt Jardine","and you are continuing to make connections with new people"

"1547570881.032100","Tue Jan 15 2019","11:48 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Okay all those statements together were too painful. But these week we’ll see you a good amount. Tonight, _maybe_ breakfast, and the Holiday Party. So we’re safe. :white_check_mark:"

"1547570932.033400","Tue Jan 15 2019","11:48 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I guess that’s all I wanted to say about that."
"1547570966.034100","Tue Jan 15 2019","11:49 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I think I mean, as long as I work with you, seeing you less will still be noticed."
"1547570996.034400","Tue Jan 15 2019","11:49 AM","Matt Jardine","I like you and I think you are good and cool"
"1547570999.034600","Tue Jan 15 2019","11:49 AM","Matt Jardine","likewise with ivan"

"1547571128.038100","Tue Jan 15 2019","11:52 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Oh! He got new music-related toys you might enjoy."
"1547571137.038300","Tue Jan 15 2019","11:52 AM","Matt Jardine","Yeah he was telling me!"
"1547571144.038500","Tue Jan 15 2019","11:52 AM","Matt Jardine","those things look cool"
"1547571169.039000","Tue Jan 15 2019","11:52 AM","Matt Jardine","Yeah even just being 100% selfish about it I think spending time with you guys is good for me"
"1547571178.039200","Tue Jan 15 2019","11:52 AM","Matt Jardine","Ok I need to do work"
"1547571189.039600","Tue Jan 15 2019","11:53 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yeah! We’re super good for you! You have to keep us."

"1547574842.040600","Tue Jan 15 2019","12:54 PM","Matt Jardine","yes food soon"
"1547574967.040900","Tue Jan 15 2019","12:56 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I’m good anytime."
"1547574971.041200","Tue Jan 15 2019","12:56 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And hungry now actually!"
"1547574996.041700","Tue Jan 15 2019","12:56 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So maybe I will go get stuff. Will wait to eat til you’re ready though. :wave:"

"1547581618.043000","Tue Jan 15 2019","2:46 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I think I am back to tea in the afternoon."
"1547581628.043300","Tue Jan 15 2019","2:47 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I have just resigned to napping instead of coffee."
"1547581788.044100","Tue Jan 15 2019","2:49 PM","Matt Jardine","Resignation has been your strategy ever since you went to VT, huh?"
"1547581814.044600","Tue Jan 15 2019","2:50 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Well, getting more sleep rather than just managing the sleepiness, yes."
"1547581838.045200","Tue Jan 15 2019","2:50 PM","Matt Jardine","Sounds like a good experiment"
"1547581845.045700","Tue Jan 15 2019","2:50 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yeah, experiment is a good word."
"1547581860.046400","Tue Jan 15 2019","2:51 PM","Matt Jardine","maybe your waking hours will be better if you sleep more"
"1547581866.046600","Tue Jan 15 2019","2:51 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I don’t know how long I’ll keep this up, but right now I’m really trying to see how much sleep I need to go through a whole day without needing a nap."
"1547581872.046800","Tue Jan 15 2019","2:51 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","That’s the goal."
"1547581879.047000","Tue Jan 15 2019","2:51 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And the water is hot."
"1547581890.047300","Tue Jan 15 2019","2:51 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I have licorice tea if you are feeling not like yourself, haha"

"1547654559.000400","Wed Jan 16 2019","11:02 AM","Matt Jardine","Yeah"
"1547654578.000600","Wed Jan 16 2019","11:02 AM","Matt Jardine","I'm not sure what to say"
"1547654591.001000","Wed Jan 16 2019","11:03 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Alan is a contractor?"
"1547654601.001600","Wed Jan 16 2019","11:03 AM","Matt Jardine","I mean, this was bound to happen eventually. This company is &gt; 10 years old and it doesn't make money."
"1547654615.002000","Wed Jan 16 2019","11:03 AM","Matt Jardine","but yeah, I thought he had made the jump to full time"
"1547654620.002200","Wed Jan 16 2019","11:03 AM","Matt Jardine","salaried"
"1547654649.002700","Wed Jan 16 2019","11:04 AM","Matt Jardine","I really like Alan and Robin, it's very sad."
"1547654688.004000","Wed Jan 16 2019","11:04 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And like, oh my gosh. Alan provides _so_ much more value to this company than I do."
"1547654694.004200","Wed Jan 16 2019","11:04 AM","Matt Jardine","Even just looking at it practically, Alan and Robin have expertise that will be unfortunate to have lost."
"1547654708.004700","Wed Jan 16 2019","11:05 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yeah, I think those are the things I’m thinking about the most."
"1547654749.005200","Wed Jan 16 2019","11:05 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Like, really? They just drew the line at contractors?"
"1547654760.005700","Wed Jan 16 2019","11:06 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","They really should’ve fired me and kept Alan."
"1547654777.006500","Wed Jan 16 2019","11:06 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Although … I guess they are having to pay me less …"
"1547654782.006700","Wed Jan 16 2019","11:06 AM","Matt Jardine","yeah"
"1547654790.007000","Wed Jan 16 2019","11:06 AM","Matt Jardine","we don't know how expensive those guys are I suppose"
"1547654844.007600","Wed Jan 16 2019","11:07 AM","Matt Jardine","also, I think contractors are easier to let go for technical reasons"
"1547654851.007900","Wed Jan 16 2019","11:07 AM","Matt Jardine","like you don't have to pay severance or whatever"
"1547654866.008200","Wed Jan 16 2019","11:07 AM","Matt Jardine","I had _no_ idea that Robin was a contractor"
"1547654919.008400","Wed Jan 16 2019","11:08 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yeah."
"1547654925.008500","Wed Jan 16 2019","11:08 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","SIGH"
"1547654931.008700","Wed Jan 16 2019","11:08 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I guess we’re not getting that rowing machine."
"1547655107.009400","Wed Jan 16 2019","11:11 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I kind of like how openly frustrated Jordi is."
"1547655110.009500","Wed Jan 16 2019","11:11 AM","Matt Jardine","haha, yes that's the real tragedy in all of this"
"1547655159.010300","Wed Jan 16 2019","11:12 AM","Matt Jardine","Yeah to jordi's point this feels a little like a catch-22"
"1547655178.010800","Wed Jan 16 2019","11:12 AM","Matt Jardine","but then again, we scaled up to make marketplace, and it doesn't seemed to have worked"
"1547655201.011400","Wed Jan 16 2019","11:13 AM","Matt Jardine","so maybe the idea is to scale back down and work hard on our core competency, which is the editor and music software"
"1547655246.012300","Wed Jan 16 2019","11:14 AM","Matt Jardine","to be honest, I prefer working at smaller companies, and I was not terribly excited about marketplace."
"1547655306.013200","Wed Jan 16 2019","11:15 AM","Matt Jardine","Maybe this will be a good year."
"1547655348.014200","Wed Jan 16 2019","11:15 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","That makes sense."

"1547671195.016300","Wed Jan 16 2019","3:39 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Hehe, aka :eyes:"
"1547671201.016400","Wed Jan 16 2019","3:40 PM","Matt Jardine","we could always play a short game in the other conference room"
"1547671219.016800","Wed Jan 16 2019","3:40 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Ha! But that one is taken too."
"1547671227.017200","Wed Jan 16 2019","3:40 PM","Matt Jardine","that ruins my joke"
"1547671244.017500","Wed Jan 16 2019","3:40 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Hehehe I got it I got it"
"1547671251.017700","Wed Jan 16 2019","3:40 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Supply closet!"

"1547671658.021300","Wed Jan 16 2019","3:47 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Hm. Noted."
"1547671678.022000","Wed Jan 16 2019","3:47 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I’ve been really enjoying my reading. I am worried about the pace, but then again, I’m like, _actually_ reading the book."
"1547671682.022300","Wed Jan 16 2019","3:48 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Not skimming."
"1547671693.022700","Wed Jan 16 2019","3:48 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Which is kind of what I hoped a class would let/force me to do, is actually read books."
"1547671707.023000","Wed Jan 16 2019","3:48 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","It just takes a lot of time."
"1547671712.023300","Wed Jan 16 2019","3:48 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And I want to work on your game, haha."
"1547671905.024000","Wed Jan 16 2019","3:51 PM","Matt Jardine","I think I might pause work on the game until your class is done"

"1547671948.025800","Wed Jan 16 2019","3:52 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Oh yeah yeah."
"1547671950.026100","Wed Jan 16 2019","3:52 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Interesting."
"1547671956.026400","Wed Jan 16 2019","3:52 PM","Matt Jardine","I think I will lose steam if I keep working on it when the conditions aren't right"
"1547671965.026800","Wed Jan 16 2019","3:52 PM","Matt Jardine","I think stopping now when I'm still excited about it is a good idea"

"1547672251.029500","Wed Jan 16 2019","3:57 PM","Matt Jardine","he has a pretty cool hair cut"
"1547672285.030000","Wed Jan 16 2019","3:58 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Your Eeyore tattoo could just be of a tail nailed to your butt!"

"1547672324.030600","Wed Jan 16 2019","3:58 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And if a potential lover didn’t get the reference, they’re out."

"1547672412.031500","Wed Jan 16 2019","4:00 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Mm, not really any different ones I guess …"
"1547672415.031700","Wed Jan 16 2019","4:00 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Maybe:"
"1547672423.032000","Wed Jan 16 2019","4:00 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","1) I still want to play the 2 player version with you."
"1547672441.032500","Wed Jan 16 2019","4:00 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","2) When I spend a lot of time playing board games with lots of rules, I have very frustrating dreams."
"1547672469.033000","Wed Jan 16 2019","4:01 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Re #2: Like, this happened when I was briefly very into sudoku."
"1547672485.033500","Wed Jan 16 2019","4:01 PM","Matt Jardine","that is interesting"
"1547672487.033700","Wed Jan 16 2019","4:01 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I would dream about sudoku, and be trying to solve it, but all the numbers kept shifting around."
"1547672511.034200","Wed Jan 16 2019","4:01 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So I end up dreaming about games and trying to play the game _but the rules don’t make sense_."
"1547672526.034500","Wed Jan 16 2019","4:02 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And that is a nightmare if Livvy ever had one."

"1547673252.035400","Wed Jan 16 2019","4:14 PM","Matt Jardine","I don't think so"
"1547673265.035800","Wed Jan 16 2019","4:14 PM","Matt Jardine","I think it deserves a more thorough examination"

"1547673312.036400","Wed Jan 16 2019","4:15 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Like you pretty immediately didn’t like that gold digging game I have."

"1548345149.010200","Thu Jan 24 2019","10:52 AM","Matt Jardine","yeah, you have to come"
"1548345225.011800","Thu Jan 24 2019","10:53 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Okay let’s do this:  I read 5–6. We transit to the gym 6:00 – 6:30. We climb 6:30 – 8:30. I transit home 8:30 – 9:00. I do the rest of my homework 9+."

"1548345632.014200","Thu Jan 24 2019","11:00 AM","Matt Jardine","true"
"1548345641.014500","Thu Jan 24 2019","11:00 AM","Matt Jardine","matt thinks he can get to the gym around 6:30"
"1548345660.015000","Thu Jan 24 2019","11:01 AM","Matt Jardine","we can push everything a little earlier if that was helpful"
"1548345666.015300","Thu Jan 24 2019","11:01 AM","Matt Jardine","it is probably not helpful though, huh"
"1548345700.016200","Thu Jan 24 2019","11:01 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Well, I could just read in the workspace at the gym, so we could move transit up so we’re for sure there when he gets there."

"1548345763.017600","Thu Jan 24 2019","11:02 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Then I would need _two_ hours!"
"1548352598.017900","Thu Jan 24 2019","12:56 PM","Matt Jardine","time for chips?"
"1548352607.018100","Thu Jan 24 2019","12:56 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yeeeeeessss."
"1548356831.018900","Thu Jan 24 2019","2:07 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Woah! I have thought of Necromunda as a supercomplicated game—which it probably is—but it has a lower complexity rating than Root on BGG."
"1548356849.019500","Thu Jan 24 2019","2:07 PM","Matt Jardine","wow"
"1548356850.019600","Thu Jan 24 2019","2:07 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But maybe that’s because the raters are skewed."
"1548356867.020200","Thu Jan 24 2019","2:07 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Like, it’s light for the time of game people who play Necromunda play."
"1548356881.020800","Thu Jan 24 2019","2:08 PM","Matt Jardine","yeah, that is probably true"
"1548356893.021400","Thu Jan 24 2019","2:08 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And Root is heavy for having so many illustrations of cute woodland creatures."
"1548356894.021500","Thu Jan 24 2019","2:08 PM","Matt Jardine","it is light compared to other 'wargames' like 40k"
"1548356920.022300","Thu Jan 24 2019","2:08 PM","Matt Jardine","i would consider necromunda to be more complex than any board game I've played"
"1548356922.022500","Thu Jan 24 2019","2:08 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Although Root is (apparently) squarely a wargame."
"1548356929.022800","Thu Jan 24 2019","2:08 PM","Matt Jardine","oh interesting"
"1548356935.023000","Thu Jan 24 2019","2:08 PM","Matt Jardine","and it's really asymetrical, right?"
"1548356944.023400","Thu Jan 24 2019","2:09 PM","Matt Jardine","maybe it's true"
"1548356949.023600","Thu Jan 24 2019","2:09 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yep. Each player plays completely differently."
"1548356961.024300","Thu Jan 24 2019","2:09 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","That probably accounts for most of the complexity."
"1548356962.024400","Thu Jan 24 2019","2:09 PM","Matt Jardine","also necromunda has many many ways to play it"
"1548356989.024900","Thu Jan 24 2019","2:09 PM","Matt Jardine","the most basic out-of-the-box way to play it is comparitively simple"
"1548356996.025300","Thu Jan 24 2019","2:09 PM","Matt Jardine","but it's meant as a demo to get your feet wet"

"1548966788.029900","Thu Jan 31 2019","3:33 PM","Matt Jardine","it will be in their access logs, at the very least"

"1549034983.013100","Fri Feb 01 2019","10:29 AM","Matt Jardine","i don't know if there is like a central theme to the way they differ"
"1549035175.015700","Fri Feb 01 2019","10:32 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Randy Woodley is a Native American teacher/theologian writing about Christianity from an indigenous perspective. Al Tizon is an Asian-American author writing about Christianity from a rather mainline evangelical perspective, but perhaps with an emphasis on showing how all aspects of Christianity fit together into one coherent/narrative whole. Both of them reference (and rely rather heavily) on the Hebrew concept of _shalom_."
"1549035270.017200","Fri Feb 01 2019","10:34 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","_Shalom_ is often translated as “peace”, but is used to mean more than non-violence or absence of conflict. It means wholeness and right relationships. Scripturally, the earth was in a state of _shalom_ before all that stuff about “the fall” and sin, etc."
"1549035434.019900","Fri Feb 01 2019","10:37 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But references to _shalom_ are throughout the whole Bible: the laws given to Israel are meant to restore _shalom_; Israelite prophets promised a coming day of _shalom_; Jesus references all these prophecies when he talks about his “kingdom of God”; and New Testament authors pick up this concept of _shalom_ spreading."
"1549035757.025100","Fri Feb 01 2019","10:42 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Woodley (Native American guy) has done a bunch of research trying to understand what values/worldview(s) are shared between American indigenous people (and to some extent, other indigenous groups around the world). He calls what is common/shared between them the “Harmony Way.” His book seems to be developing the argument that what he has found in the “Harmony Way” is incredibly similar to the theological concept of _shalom_."
"1549035832.026400","Fri Feb 01 2019","10:43 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Part of that argument involves saying that white/western Christian traditions would do well to listen better to indigenous voices if they want to understand and do Christianity better."

"1549036060.030600","Fri Feb 01 2019","10:47 AM","Matt Jardine","is there a prescriptive thing that both books ask Christians to do?"

"1549036093.031600","Fri Feb 01 2019","10:48 AM","Matt Jardine","yeah I think you've discovered a really good way to write drafts"

"1549036199.035300","Fri Feb 01 2019","10:49 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Oh?"
"1549036210.035500","Fri Feb 01 2019","10:50 AM","Matt Jardine","I think I was kind of fired up from my trip"
"1549036284.036000","Fri Feb 01 2019","10:51 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Aw, thanks for saying something. I don’t remember you being dismissive about studying the Bible."
"1549036330.037500","Fri Feb 01 2019","10:52 AM","Matt Jardine","I said something along the lines of ""We've had two thousand years to over analyse the Bible, and read into it all sorts of things that weren't intended"""
"1549036333.037700","Fri Feb 01 2019","10:52 AM","Matt Jardine","which is like"
"1549036340.038000","Fri Feb 01 2019","10:52 AM","Matt Jardine","certainly at least an oversimplification"
"1549036415.038500","Fri Feb 01 2019","10:53 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Oh! I do remember that but that didn’t feel bad or problematic or dismissive in any way."
"1549036433.039000","Fri Feb 01 2019","10:53 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Heh, maybe it should’ve."
"1549036493.040600","Fri Feb 01 2019","10:54 AM","Matt Jardine","Oh, I thought that had upset you at the time :stuck_out_tongue:"
"1549036496.040900","Fri Feb 01 2019","10:54 AM","Matt Jardine","nevermind"
"1549036540.041800","Fri Feb 01 2019","10:55 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But I think there are lots of people who read the Bible like a magic book—like, opening to a random page and seeing what the Lord has to say to them today—and there are other people who read it like a historic text and try to understand it meant at the time, what it meant to people later in history, etc."
"1549036565.042400","Fri Feb 01 2019","10:56 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Both groups can overanalyse, surely."
"1549036613.043500","Fri Feb 01 2019","10:56 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But the second group is like, no more guilty of that than other historians/humanities folk."

"1549036626.044100","Fri Feb 01 2019","10:57 AM","Matt Jardine","Right!"

"1549036767.047200","Fri Feb 01 2019","10:59 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","One more thing I was going to say—"
"1549036801.047800","Fri Feb 01 2019","11:00 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Oh, this is not the thing but just curious: what made you think you had upset me by that comment?"
"1549036820.048400","Fri Feb 01 2019","11:00 AM","Matt Jardine","facial expression, mostly"
"1549036843.048800","Fri Feb 01 2019","11:00 AM","Matt Jardine","but I was probably reading into it too much"
"1549036850.049000","Fri Feb 01 2019","11:00 AM","Matt Jardine","which is ironic, haha"
"1549036872.049500","Fri Feb 01 2019","11:01 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Hehe, oh interesting. Maybe I did react to that in a way I’m not remembering now."
"1549036909.051000","Fri Feb 01 2019","11:01 AM","Matt Jardine","It might have been more of a ""that's not entirely accurate"" look than a ""I am upset"" look"
"1549036970.051600","Fri Feb 01 2019","11:02 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","What I do remember is you saying something about the development of the idea of Satan. I do think you sometimes say things you’ve heard about the Bible very confidently, and inside I’m like :joy: Oh Matt, you know so little about this. I _also_ know so little about this, but I am immersed in the world enough to know what I don’t know."
"1549037041.052700","Fri Feb 01 2019","11:04 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Like, I don’t know enough to say “Oh, yes! That’s one theory about the development of the concept of Satan; here are some others! I find that one most compelling because … ”"
"1549037088.053700","Fri Feb 01 2019","11:04 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But I know they are there and I would probably never speak as confidently about any of them as you did."
"1549037093.054000","Fri Feb 01 2019","11:04 AM","Matt Jardine","Yeah, this is definitely true"
"1549037108.054300","Fri Feb 01 2019","11:05 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I guess, sometimes the confidence with which you say things seems uncharacteristic."
"1549037151.055200","Fri Feb 01 2019","11:05 AM","Matt Jardine","I think sometimes I speak in a way to be impactful rather than accurate"
"1549037162.055500","Fri Feb 01 2019","11:06 AM","Matt Jardine","which is maybe not great"
"1549037168.055700","Fri Feb 01 2019","11:06 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yeah, and honestly, that’s probably more practical, haha."
"1549037208.056500","Fri Feb 01 2019","11:06 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But I think those are the moments where I feel some conversational discomfort, because if I can’t wholeheartedly buy into what you’re saying, is it worth it to disagree if I have nothing to disagree with?"
"1549037224.056700","Fri Feb 01 2019","11:07 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I mean, nothing to counter with?"
"1549037244.057200","Fri Feb 01 2019","11:07 AM","Matt Jardine","Well"
"1549037249.057400","Fri Feb 01 2019","11:07 AM","Matt Jardine","I think you are right"
"1549037259.057800","Fri Feb 01 2019","11:07 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Anyway that just seems exhausting."
"1549037309.059400","Fri Feb 01 2019","11:08 AM","Matt Jardine","so yeah, in the moment you could probably say something like ""That's interesting, but there are whole fields of academia that can't agree on this stuff, I don't think something you heard in a podcast is going to clear it all up"""
"1549037322.059600","Fri Feb 01 2019","11:08 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","If you were looking for a thing you could do to ease that discomfort, you could add “I’ve heard that … ” to the beginning and “… do you guys know anything about that?” to the end."

"1549572652.011900","Thu Feb 07 2019","3:50 PM","Matt Jardine","is getting onto the rails console on a daemon server"
"1549572662.012200","Thu Feb 07 2019","3:51 PM","Matt Jardine","finding the score in question"
"1549572688.012800","Thu Feb 07 2019","3:51 PM","Matt Jardine","and there will be a DocumentRole for the score that is this user's relationship to it"
"1549572717.013400","Thu Feb 07 2019","3:51 PM","Matt Jardine","it's probably set to 'view' or 'comment'"
"1549572721.013600","Thu Feb 07 2019","3:52 PM","Matt Jardine","it needs to be 'edit'"

"1549573067.016800","Thu Feb 07 2019","3:57 PM","Matt Jardine","it might be that the score owner doesn't need a document_role record"
"1549573083.017500","Thu Feb 07 2019","3:58 PM","Matt Jardine","I have this memory of deleting one of these in this situation, and it made things worse"

"1549573096.018200","Thu Feb 07 2019","3:58 PM","Matt Jardine","if this works, I don't think there is a down side"

"1549573299.025300","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:01 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But the user had _no_ access to the score (couldn’t even view it), so I don’t know what document_role could’ve allowed that …?"

"1549574221.035700","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:17 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","This is just for education."
"1549574230.036100","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:17 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Obviously I will still have to go up and fix the problem."
"1549574231.036300","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:17 PM","Matt Jardine","why is this still possible in the UI though?"
"1549574257.036700","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:17 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Oh, because I viewed the score and shared it with him _as an admin_, not as him."
"1549574260.036900","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:17 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Or her."
"1549574272.037300","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:17 PM","Matt Jardine","but i thought the owner of the score doesn't show up in the list"
"1549574287.037600","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:18 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Mm, no, the _logged in user_ doesn’t show up on the list."
"1549574293.037900","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:18 PM","Matt Jardine","oh lol"
"1549574306.038400","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:18 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I just verified on a score of mine that I can’t share it with myself."
"1549574326.038800","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:18 PM","Matt Jardine","are there any situations where that will be a problem?"
"1549574330.039000","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:18 PM","Matt Jardine","can a score have 2 owners?"
"1549574334.039200","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:18 PM","Matt Jardine","I guess not"
"1549574348.039500","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:19 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","There doesn’t seem to be any UI way to change the _owner_ of a score."
"1549574352.039700","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:19 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","owner/author"
"1549574361.039900","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:19 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Admin or otherwise."
"1549574418.040300","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:20 PM","Matt Jardine","and the owner of the score is the only one who can ever change sharing permissions"
"1549574431.040800","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:20 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Correct."
"1549574432.040900","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:20 PM","Matt Jardine","(besides nf admins i guess)"
"1549574447.041600","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:20 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I think admins are given the permissions of owners."
"1549574451.041800","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:20 PM","Matt Jardine","so that technically satisfies our requirements, but it seems wrong to me"
"1549574457.042000","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:20 PM","Matt Jardine","the principal of the thing"
"1549574495.042700","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:21 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Which part seems wrong?"
"1549574522.043300","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:22 PM","Matt Jardine","i think the fact that a user owns the score is the reason you can't share/unshare with that user"
"1549574528.043600","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:22 PM","Matt Jardine","not that they are the person currently logged in"
"1549574555.044100","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:22 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yeah, that’s a great point."
"1549574570.044600","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:22 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And one I didn’t think about when I made the javascript fix. :sweat_smile:"
"1549574576.044800","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:22 PM","Matt Jardine","it just so happens that this works"
"1549574593.045600","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:23 PM","Matt Jardine","here's an interesting point"
"1549574599.046000","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:23 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Also, I just did the thing in the admin where I unshared it with the owner and now there is _no_ document_roles for this score."
"1549574599.046100","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:23 PM","Matt Jardine","if a user shares a score with an admin"
"1549574606.046400","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:23 PM","Matt Jardine","the admin can't go in an unshare it with themself"
"1549574612.046600","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:23 PM","Matt Jardine","ok cool!"
"1549574632.047100","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:23 PM","Matt Jardine","I guess its good we implemented this way so we could learn more about document roles!"
"1549574702.047400","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:25 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Do you have sql pro or something like that?"
"1549574712.047900","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:25 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","To look at the database without being sshed up there?"
"1549574730.048300","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:25 PM","Matt Jardine","the cli can connect to remote hosts"
"1549574736.048500","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:25 PM","Matt Jardine","that's what I have always used"
"1549574755.049000","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:25 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Oh huh."
"1549574758.049200","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:25 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I don’t know what that means."

"1549574965.052900","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:29 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So you could be al sql-ly and look for all `documents` where `document_role` = `nil` …?"

"1549574983.053500","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:29 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But you could look for documents where there is no associated document role?"
"1549575004.054000","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:30 PM","Matt Jardine","yeah, you would do what is called a ""left join"""
"1549575033.054500","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:30 PM","Matt Jardine","and only take the documents where there is no document_role"
"1549575118.056000","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:31 PM","Matt Jardine","I think it would look something like ``` select   * from   documents   left join document_roles on (document_roles.document_id = documents.id) where   document_roles.id is null ```"
"1549575155.056500","Thu Feb 07 2019","4:32 PM","Matt Jardine","you'd probably only want to select the fields you care about"

"1550175579.035700","Thu Feb 14 2019","3:19 PM","Matt Jardine","and it apparently has 0 effect on the database"
"1550175583.036000","Thu Feb 14 2019","3:19 PM","Matt Jardine","so it's all good"
"1550175594.036300","Thu Feb 14 2019","3:19 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yeah but leaving a long-running process potentially unsupervised seems better with a replica."

"1550175610.037100","Thu Feb 14 2019","3:20 PM","Matt Jardine","plus we could have done it from your machine"
"1550175619.037500","Thu Feb 14 2019","3:20 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Oh interesting. Like, the machine I’m on might get shut down by AWS?"

"1550175663.039700","Thu Feb 14 2019","3:21 PM","Matt Jardine","yeah actually I think so"
"1550175682.040000","Thu Feb 14 2019","3:21 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Like, if I just ssh up again in a new tab?"

"1550175734.042400","Thu Feb 14 2019","3:22 PM","Matt Jardine","I doubt it will be catastrophic"
"1550175754.042900","Thu Feb 14 2019","3:22 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","The worst thing that could happen is that I’d have to start the 5 hour process over again …?"

"1550175771.043400","Thu Feb 14 2019","3:22 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","That’s pretty bad, haha"

"1550175928.045500","Thu Feb 14 2019","3:25 PM","Matt Jardine","maybe that's what happens ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
"1550175940.046000","Thu Feb 14 2019","3:25 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I should be able to do `less authorless_scores.csv`, right?"

"1550763033.018700","Thu Feb 21 2019","10:30 AM","Matt Jardine","could it be a post-climbing thing?"
"1550763048.019100","Thu Feb 21 2019","10:30 AM","Matt Jardine","or a weekend during the day thing?"
"1550763065.019500","Thu Feb 21 2019","10:31 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But I mean, I should maybe think to myself at the beginning of each week: Livvy, are you going to want to play a game? When are you going to play that game so that it doesn’t disrupt everything?"

"1552401433.010800","Tue Mar 12 2019","10:37 AM","Matt Jardine","I wonder if there is a point to the staircase"

"1552401472.011900","Tue Mar 12 2019","10:37 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","You could try becoming a turtle on the stairs or something."

"1553025432.032500","Tue Mar 19 2019","3:57 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Ah how fun I want to stop working."
"1553025437.032700","Tue Mar 19 2019","3:57 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So I can go make things."
"1553025461.033500","Tue Mar 19 2019","3:57 PM","Matt Jardine","the twitch stream sometimes has things that require modest sums of money, so that would actually be a good candidate for grants"

"1553026052.043500","Tue Mar 19 2019","4:07 PM","Matt Jardine","preferably"

"1553027163.044700","Tue Mar 19 2019","4:26 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Oh one more question: how would you feel if you had to have an advisor (or some other trendier term)?"
"1553027177.045000","Tue Mar 19 2019","4:26 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Like, there was someone dedicated to helping keep you accountable."

"1553027545.048300","Tue Mar 19 2019","4:32 PM","Matt Jardine","but I like the moon more than bureaucracy"
"1553027551.048800","Tue Mar 19 2019","4:32 PM","Matt Jardine","so I'm going with moon themed"
"1553027559.049400","Tue Mar 19 2019","4:32 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","What if everything was based on the moon cycle."
"1553027562.049600","Tue Mar 19 2019","4:32 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Like, deadlines and stuff."
"1553027563.049800","Tue Mar 19 2019","4:32 PM","Matt Jardine","plus there are all sorts of cycles already built in"
"1553027566.050200","Tue Mar 19 2019","4:32 PM","Matt Jardine","yeah, exactly"
"1553027569.050500","Tue Mar 19 2019","4:32 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Would that be awesome or annoying?"
"1553027575.050800","Tue Mar 19 2019","4:32 PM","Matt Jardine","and you could borrow a lot from paganism"
"1553027577.051200","Tue Mar 19 2019","4:32 PM","Matt Jardine","well"

"1554302567.114900","Wed Apr 03 2019","10:42 AM","Matt Jardine","when running our server?"

"1554302573.115300","Wed Apr 03 2019","10:42 AM","Matt Jardine","yeah, I wish we didn't"
"1554302578.115600","Wed Apr 03 2019","10:42 AM","Matt Jardine","we didn't used to"
"1554302585.115900","Wed Apr 03 2019","10:43 AM","Matt Jardine","it's to serve the 'assets'"
"1554302592.116300","Wed Apr 03 2019","10:43 AM","Matt Jardine","which is basically all the javascript and css and stuff"
"1554302598.116800","Wed Apr 03 2019","10:43 AM","Matt Jardine","because it needs to much processing"
"1554302619.117400","Wed Apr 03 2019","10:43 AM","Matt Jardine","the source code that you and I write gets transformed by webpack into something the browser can actually use"
"1554302634.117700","Wed Apr 03 2019","10:43 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","How is webpack related to node?"
"1554302644.118200","Wed Apr 03 2019","10:44 AM","Matt Jardine","oh, that is a good question"
"1554302663.119000","Wed Apr 03 2019","10:44 AM","Matt Jardine","so, node is the actual part that serves the files"
"1554302701.120000","Wed Apr 03 2019","10:45 AM","Matt Jardine","webpack is a node package (what node calls libraries) that does all of the transformation of our source code"
"1554302736.120500","Wed Apr 03 2019","10:45 AM","Matt Jardine","node is weird in that you can just make programs that have nothing to do with web servers"
"1554302748.120900","Wed Apr 03 2019","10:45 AM","Matt Jardine","webpack technically doesn't need to also _serve_ the files it creates"
"1554302768.121300","Wed Apr 03 2019","10:46 AM","Matt Jardine","for instance, in our build process it doesn't start up the web server part"
"1554302783.121600","Wed Apr 03 2019","10:46 AM","Matt Jardine","but node also has all the server stuff built in ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"

"1554302913.123700","Wed Apr 03 2019","10:48 AM","Matt Jardine","well, both I guess"
"1554302920.124100","Wed Apr 03 2019","10:48 AM","Matt Jardine","I kinda mean webpack more specifically"
"1554302923.124400","Wed Apr 03 2019","10:48 AM","Matt Jardine","which is a node program"
"1554302928.124700","Wed Apr 03 2019","10:48 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Okay."
"1554302948.125200","Wed Apr 03 2019","10:49 AM","Matt Jardine","but the process of transforming the files doesn't actually require an http server"

"1554303486.133900","Wed Apr 03 2019","10:58 AM","Matt Jardine","or at least it can"

"1554303603.137300","Wed Apr 03 2019","11:00 AM","Matt Jardine","like DNS. Some basic HTTP things. AWS is still kind of scary to me"
"1554303615.137700","Wed Apr 03 2019","11:00 AM","Matt Jardine","React makes me feel pretty weird, too"
"1554303690.139000","Wed Apr 03 2019","11:01 AM","Matt Jardine","Also I would like to know more about computers at a fundamental level. Like how to make native programs"

"1554304206.152700","Wed Apr 03 2019","11:10 AM","Matt Jardine","you could also try to solve it on your own by just looking at the code"
"1554304218.153100","Wed Apr 03 2019","11:10 AM","Matt Jardine","maybe that's a good idea before going to ken anyway"

"1554390144.019400","Thu Apr 04 2019","11:02 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Like, can you just give any hint on where to start?"
"1554390182.019700","Thu Apr 04 2019","11:03 AM","Matt Jardine","i guess there are two things to think about"
"1554390198.020200","Thu Apr 04 2019","11:03 AM","Matt Jardine","1.) What is it doing now 2.) What do we want it to do"
"1554390249.020800","Thu Apr 04 2019","11:04 AM","Matt Jardine","it might be good to start by looking at the current community member search stuff"
"1554390254.021000","Thu Apr 04 2019","11:04 AM","Matt Jardine","even just the ui"
"1554390294.021700","Thu Apr 04 2019","11:04 AM","Matt Jardine","umm, here's why I say that"
"1554390296.021900","Thu Apr 04 2019","11:04 AM","Matt Jardine","one sec"
"1554390362.022200","Thu Apr 04 2019","11:06 AM","Matt Jardine","ok, so this bug is where this whole thing started"
"1554390363.022400","Thu Apr 04 2019","11:06 AM","Matt Jardine","<https://github.com/noteflight/webapp/issues/6348>"
"1554390441.022600","Thu Apr 04 2019","11:07 AM","Matt Jardine","look at my comment at the bottom"
"1554390506.023500","Thu Apr 04 2019","11:08 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So we need to get all SiteMembers into elasticsearch so that it can use the new UI—"
"1554390520.023800","Thu Apr 04 2019","11:08 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","but then we have to figure out all the exceptions for who sees and doesn’t see all site members"
"1554390573.024000","Thu Apr 04 2019","11:09 AM","Matt Jardine","hmm, yeah"
"1554390597.024500","Thu Apr 04 2019","11:09 AM","Matt Jardine","I don't know how to limit stuff like that in elastic search"
"1554390621.025000","Thu Apr 04 2019","11:10 AM","Matt Jardine","the reason I made the card is figuring all that out felt way bigger than the original bug description :disappointed:"
"1554390634.025400","Thu Apr 04 2019","11:10 AM","Matt Jardine","I'm sure it wont be terrible"
"1554390674.026100","Thu Apr 04 2019","11:11 AM","Matt Jardine","a place you could start would be just making this search use the new UI"
"1554390685.026500","Thu Apr 04 2019","11:11 AM","Matt Jardine","and that might send you down the path of figuring out how elastic search works"
"1554390745.026900","Thu Apr 04 2019","11:12 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Fantastic."
"1554390754.027300","Thu Apr 04 2019","11:12 AM","Matt Jardine","I think the current Javascript for that is happening in siteMembers.js"
"1554390759.027500","Thu Apr 04 2019","11:12 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","The urge to procrastiwork on other things is strong."
"1554390774.027900","Thu Apr 04 2019","11:12 AM","Matt Jardine","hmmm"
"1554390792.028300","Thu Apr 04 2019","11:13 AM","Matt Jardine","ok promise to get started on it"
"1554390801.028600","Thu Apr 04 2019","11:13 AM","Matt Jardine","and after I finish this tooltip thing I will peer with you"
"1554390813.029100","Thu Apr 04 2019","11:13 AM","Matt Jardine","the next task I have is also not very fun"
"1554390837.029900","Thu Apr 04 2019","11:13 AM","Matt Jardine","I should learn how all of this ES stuff works too"
"1554390842.030100","Thu Apr 04 2019","11:14 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Haha, okay. I will start working on this for a focused 20 minutes and see where that gets me."

"1554755275.025100","Mon Apr 08 2019","4:27 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But man. The behavior on these pages is more complex than I thought. Because in the “members” tab in any group, there are also _more_ tabs where you can look at *Requests*, *Invitations*, *Banned*, etc. And in all of those sub-tabs, you can use the search bar (with it’s old UI) to search/filter those results."
"1554755281.025300","Mon Apr 08 2019","4:28 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I don’t think the new UI handles anything like that."

"1554755718.026100","Mon Apr 08 2019","4:35 PM","Matt Jardine","so I imagine those also get the ugly/broken double search bar?"
"1554755737.026500","Mon Apr 08 2019","4:35 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Well, I’m still saying it’s all confined to that Group &gt; Members tab."

"1554755771.027600","Mon Apr 08 2019","4:36 PM","Matt Jardine","requests and invitations are a different list of objects you are searching on though"
"1554755786.027900","Mon Apr 08 2019","4:36 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I think the unique thing about this old search (UI and underlying process) is that it can search the list you’re looking at."

"1554755808.028900","Mon Apr 08 2019","4:36 PM","Matt Jardine","so maybe there is a case for not adding this to ES"
"1554755813.029100","Mon Apr 08 2019","4:36 PM","Matt Jardine","because it really is a different use case"
"1554755819.029500","Mon Apr 08 2019","4:36 PM","Matt Jardine","and instead making a UI that works for this use case"

"1556203329.019100","Thu Apr 25 2019","10:42 AM","Matt Jardine","I think he'd be more likely to listen to you anyway"

"1556203577.022100","Thu Apr 25 2019","10:46 AM","Matt Jardine","like he'd be more likely to get defensive if it was coming from me"
"1556203610.022600","Thu Apr 25 2019","10:46 AM","Matt Jardine","I don't think I could say it in a way that came across as concerned rather than critical"
"1556203759.024100","Thu Apr 25 2019","10:49 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Oh huh. I probably _wouldn’t_ be trying to convey the message of “I don’t think you handled this interaction well.” I’d probably be trying to communicate the message of “In my mind, the ideal company would handle this interaction this way.

"1556203847.024700","Thu Apr 25 2019","10:50 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Anyway, I will try. I wish we had regular meetings with John like we do with Rick, even if less frequently."

"1556204396.032800","Thu Apr 25 2019","10:59 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Like, maybe he thought long and hard about all the ways to handle this and picked that one. Or maybe he needs more imagination. Or maybe I can be persuaded that his way is idea."

"1557864161.006700","Tue May 14 2019","4:02 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I showed you how the avatar is showing up on the left side next to the NF logo, right?"
"1557864203.007700","Tue May 14 2019","4:03 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","That’s happening because my changes make it `position: relative` instead of `absolute`, and for some moment there at the beginning, the middle palettes haven’t loaded, so it’s just scooted all the way over next to the logo because it’s the only other thing."
"1557864233.008400","Tue May 14 2019","4:03 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But I really need it to be `relative`. :white_frowning_face:"

"1557864737.009300","Tue May 14 2019","4:12 PM","Matt Jardine","you could hide it until the score is more settled, but that seems a little sad"
"1557864789.010400","Tue May 14 2019","4:13 PM","Matt Jardine","I applaud your resolve in trying to keep things simple by avoiding `absolute` and `float`"
"1557864812.011000","Tue May 14 2019","4:13 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Oooh … I forgot about float."
"1557864815.011200","Tue May 14 2019","4:13 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So that was not resolve."
"1557864823.011600","Tue May 14 2019","4:13 PM","Matt Jardine","haha shucks"
"1557864827.011800","Tue May 14 2019","4:13 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But I assume that would have the same problem?"
"1557864838.012100","Tue May 14 2019","4:13 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I mean, the same problem as `absolute`."
"1557864847.012400","Tue May 14 2019","4:14 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Because it doesn’t take up space?"
"1557864852.012600","Tue May 14 2019","4:14 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I need it to take up space."
"1557864901.013100","Tue May 14 2019","4:15 PM","Matt Jardine","so I guess the problem is that the things that would normally push it to the right don't exist right when the page loads"
"1557864944.013900","Tue May 14 2019","4:15 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","yep."
"1557864956.014200","Tue May 14 2019","4:15 PM","Matt Jardine","maybe you could add some sort of spacer element that pushes the avatar to the right and disappears when everything else shows up"
"1557864985.015100","Tue May 14 2019","4:16 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Or just make it absolutely positioned until everything else shows up, then make it relative."
"1557864987.015300","Tue May 14 2019","4:16 PM","Matt Jardine","maybe you could absolutely position the avatar and then switch it to relative when the time is right"
"1557864989.015600","Tue May 14 2019","4:16 PM","Matt Jardine","yeah"
"1557864999.015900","Tue May 14 2019","4:16 PM","Matt Jardine","or hide it altogether"
"1557865007.016200","Tue May 14 2019","4:16 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Do we have some sort of `ready` check?"
"1557865011.016400","Tue May 14 2019","4:16 PM","Matt Jardine","or hide the whole palette until it's ready"
"1557865013.016600","Tue May 14 2019","4:16 PM","Matt Jardine","umm"
"1557865030.017300","Tue May 14 2019","4:17 PM","Matt Jardine","KO does give you some sort of 'template ready' callback"
"1557865046.017600","Tue May 14 2019","4:17 PM","Matt Jardine","but I can't guarantee that will be useful for you"
"1557865055.017900","Tue May 14 2019","4:17 PM","Matt Jardine","I'm not sure how all of that stuff is structured"
"1557865067.018100","Tue May 14 2019","4:17 PM","Matt Jardine","let me find it"
"1557865076.018300","Tue May 14 2019","4:17 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Bleughk."
"1557865098.018900","Tue May 14 2019","4:18 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","This seems so insignificant. But I think it will feel buggy to people if I leave it as is."
"1557865336.019400","Tue May 14 2019","4:22 PM","Matt Jardine","yeah, and it's looking like it's going to be some work to make it look right :confused:"

"1559143068.023500","Wed May 29 2019","11:17 AM","Matt Jardine","we could introduce some sort of `REPORTING_ENV` variable, and then set the paths based on that"

"1559230606.007600","Thu May 30 2019","11:36 AM","Matt Jardine","but that doesn't really matter"

"1559230820.014500","Thu May 30 2019","11:40 AM","Matt Jardine","which is why I'm hopeful we can just do it in `reporting`"
"1559230843.015000","Thu May 30 2019","11:40 AM","Matt Jardine","the way I see it, webapp doesn't _own_ the database, it just _uses_ it"

"1559231152.018100","Thu May 30 2019","11:45 AM","Matt Jardine","or you could just make some simple rake tasks that do direct sql :slightly_smiling_face:"

"1559848519.013800","Thu Jun 06 2019","3:15 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So, that code that I ran above, I didn’t let it put everything, I stopped it before it finished."
"1559848574.014500","Thu Jun 06 2019","3:16 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But I ran something similar where instead of putting the subscription, I just put the count, and that counted all the way up to … very high: ``` ... 70316 70317 70318 70319 70320 70321 =&gt; nil [14] pry(main)&gt; Recurly::Subscription.count =&gt; 70338 ```"

"1559921937.005500","Fri Jun 07 2019","11:38 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","You have a method `naturalize` which takes the attributes from a Recurly::Subscription (or invoice or adjustment) and turns them into something we can put in our database."

"1559922166.009900","Fri Jun 07 2019","11:42 AM","Matt Jardine","maybe instead of creating a record, naturalize should just return the `attrs` hash"
"1559922183.010300","Fri Jun 07 2019","11:43 AM","Matt Jardine","and then the caller can decide if it wants to create a new model or not"
"1559922190.010600","Fri Jun 07 2019","11:43 AM","Matt Jardine","ehhh but they are all going to do the same thing"
"1559922206.011100","Fri Jun 07 2019","11:43 AM","Matt Jardine","yeah maybe naturalize should do the find_or_create instead of the create"

"1559935680.019800","Fri Jun 07 2019","3:28 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Also, in this table, do you think it’s worth noting the number of records updated/added?"
"1559935717.020600","Fri Jun 07 2019","3:28 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Like, there could be `subscriptions_updated`, `subscriptions_added`, and similar for `invoices` and `adjustments`."

"1559935824.022900","Fri Jun 07 2019","3:30 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yeah, I guessed like `running` or `complete`, etc."

"1560200255.062100","Mon Jun 10 2019","4:57 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","First of all, now the `:load` task looks at the last record in the `reporting_downloads` table to base its query on."
"1560200268.062600","Mon Jun 10 2019","4:57 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But there will be no records in that table yet."
"1560200348.062800","Mon Jun 10 2019","4:59 PM","Matt Jardine","hmm"
"1560200354.063200","Mon Jun 10 2019","4:59 PM","Matt Jardine","what would you like it to do in this case?"
"1560200370.063600","Mon Jun 10 2019","4:59 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Well, the `:load` task could take an optional argument."
"1560200385.064200","Mon Jun 10 2019","4:59 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So that you could get it to do the update/create thing from any date that you want."

"1560200485.066100","Mon Jun 10 2019","5:01 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Maybe that second option is best."
"1560200522.067400","Mon Jun 10 2019","5:02 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","If you’re trying to load stuff from earlier than the last report, it’s probably because things are out of sync."

"1560200540.068400","Mon Jun 10 2019","5:02 PM","Matt Jardine","those options sound good"
"1560200559.069000","Mon Jun 10 2019","5:02 PM","Matt Jardine","there is also the option of making `:load` load everything in the case that it's table is empty"
"1560200595.069200","Mon Jun 10 2019","5:03 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Hmmm."

"1562695015.024100","Tue Jul 09 2019","1:56 PM","Matt Jardine","I would venture to say that no relationship is this ideal relationship, but I guess I can't know that"
"1562695020.024400","Tue Jul 09 2019","1:57 PM","Matt Jardine","right"
"1562695053.025500","Tue Jul 09 2019","1:57 PM","Matt Jardine","so you think people with these unacceptable secrets should just never have partners?"
"1562695074.026200","Tue Jul 09 2019","1:57 PM","Matt Jardine","or that if you have an otherwise good relationship, if you are hiding something like this, you should call it off?"
"1562695086.026700","Tue Jul 09 2019","1:58 PM","Matt Jardine","other examples would be like reformed criminals"
"1562695087.026900","Tue Jul 09 2019","1:58 PM","Matt Jardine","stuff like that"
"1562695100.027400","Tue Jul 09 2019","1:58 PM","Matt Jardine","things in your past you want to leave there"

"1562695194.029700","Tue Jul 09 2019","1:59 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But in the more general/likely/serious cases you’re talking about—"
"1562695201.030000","Tue Jul 09 2019","2:00 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I think more people should be less scared away."
"1562695211.030200","Tue Jul 09 2019","2:00 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I don’t know. We’re all monsters."
"1562695258.031300","Tue Jul 09 2019","2:00 PM","Matt Jardine","I think the last time we talked about this, the example of crushes came up"
"1562695270.031700","Tue Jul 09 2019","2:01 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Listen, I come from a culture that values keeping relationships (specifically marriages) together, so there’s lots of help for working through this stuff."

"1562695671.039000","Tue Jul 09 2019","2:07 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Okay that is a super sloppy example."
"1562695698.039600","Tue Jul 09 2019","2:08 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But tact seems like speaking true (maybe painful) things in kindness, when relevant."
"1562695715.040100","Tue Jul 09 2019","2:08 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Lying seems like hiding stuff that would be better to be told directly than found out though other channels."

"1562695948.044400","Tue Jul 09 2019","2:12 PM","Matt Jardine","Ok, one more example I'd like to talk about. Things that are inconsequential to you, but important to your partner. ""Yes honey, I like this Death Metal record you put out a lot"""
"1562695974.045100","Tue Jul 09 2019","2:12 PM","Matt Jardine","maybe you don't really like Death Metal, or your partners version of it, but they are insecure about it and you want to be supportive of it"

"1562696085.047800","Tue Jul 09 2019","2:14 PM","Matt Jardine","what if it was a board game"
"1562696089.048000","Tue Jul 09 2019","2:14 PM","Matt Jardine","and it wasn't very good"
"1562696095.048200","Tue Jul 09 2019","2:14 PM","Matt Jardine","something you _do_ understand"
"1562696101.048400","Tue Jul 09 2019","2:15 PM","Matt Jardine","and they worked really hard on it"
"1562696104.048700","Tue Jul 09 2019","2:15 PM","Matt Jardine","but it sucked anyway"

"1562696130.049700","Tue Jul 09 2019","2:15 PM","Matt Jardine","maybe it was a surprise"

"1562696158.050400","Tue Jul 09 2019","2:15 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","In this case, they directly ask me if this is a good board game?"

"1562696214.052000","Tue Jul 09 2019","2:16 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","It’s ‘so do you think it’s a good game?’ that’s the more damning question."

"1562767698.008200","Wed Jul 10 2019","10:08 AM","Matt Jardine","I was talking about it this weekend with Jon"

"1562767744.009300","Wed Jul 10 2019","10:09 AM","Matt Jardine","but again, it's not like anyone did anything wrong"

"1562767840.011500","Wed Jul 10 2019","10:10 AM","Matt Jardine","the intention wasn't to keep it from corrin _forever_"
"1562767865.012100","Wed Jul 10 2019","10:11 AM","Matt Jardine","we had talked about coming clean a while ago, but the timing wasn't right for a couple of reasons"

"1562767923.013100","Wed Jul 10 2019","10:12 AM","Matt Jardine","anyway, it isn't a big deal. Corrin seems fine, generally. We talked about it for a while."

At some point I said something like “Oh, I didn’t feel like we were in conflict” because of some sort of weird way in which I am pushing off the bad feelings of exclusion as the fault of other people, or onto unfortunate circumstances, and making it out like really, you and I were on the same side.  And I still stand by some parts of that, I guess, but also it’s shitty. 1) It’s not fair to  (or even accurate of) the other people and 2) you helped me see how _I_ said some pretty dismissive things too.  And I’m very sorry.  Thanks again for saying something."

"1566492364.008300","Thu Aug 22 2019","12:46 PM","Matt Jardine","he was usually better about tests than jordi"

"1566492394.008900","Thu Aug 22 2019","12:46 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I mean, he set up the whole Redux store and everything, so I assume."

"1566492449.011000","Thu Aug 22 2019","12:47 PM","Matt Jardine","but I worry that it's too far removed from what you are doing"
"1566492458.011400","Thu Aug 22 2019","12:47 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Well, can I see?"
"1566492458.011500","Thu Aug 22 2019","12:47 PM","Matt Jardine","also I admittedly get a little lazy with testing sometimes"

"1566492466.012000","Thu Aug 22 2019","12:47 PM","Matt Jardine","let me take a look"

"1566492484.012600","Thu Aug 22 2019","12:48 PM","Matt Jardine","meanwhile, let's try to remember what David might have contributed to react"
"1566492494.012900","Thu Aug 22 2019","12:48 PM","Matt Jardine","oh, there's the account overview page"
"1566492498.013100","Thu Aug 22 2019","12:48 PM","Matt Jardine","that jordi did"
"1566492499.013300","Thu Aug 22 2019","12:48 PM","Matt Jardine","that's all react"
"1566492507.013600","Thu Aug 22 2019","12:48 PM","Matt Jardine","I think he worked pretty closely with david on that"
"1566492582.014000","Thu Aug 22 2019","12:49 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Sometimes there are just snapshots."
"1566492588.014300","Thu Aug 22 2019","12:49 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","That might be okay for the test I’m working on."

"1566492629.015700","Thu Aug 22 2019","12:50 PM","Matt Jardine","`client/src/js/__tests__/admin/components/ProductPage.test.js`"
"1566492665.017100","Thu Aug 22 2019","12:51 PM","Matt Jardine","I think this snapshot approach to testing is actually pretty good for components"
"1566492671.017500","Thu Aug 22 2019","12:51 PM","Matt Jardine","better than looking at values of observables, anyway"
"1566492683.017900","Thu Aug 22 2019","12:51 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I think really the only things I would want to test on this Component are that: - It only renders the `ProductOwnedHeader` if the viewer is owner (not author or previewer), and that - It only renders the `Recommendations` section if the viewer is previewing."
"1566492708.018100","Thu Aug 22 2019","12:51 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","That’s the only logic it’s doing now."
"1566492836.019000","Thu Aug 22 2019","12:53 PM","Matt Jardine","sounds like you can do that with snapshots"
"1566492837.019200","Thu Aug 22 2019","12:53 PM","Matt Jardine","to me"
"1566492854.019700","Thu Aug 22 2019","12:54 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Okay. What about how it uses a selector?"
"1566492865.020100","Thu Aug 22 2019","12:54 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","How do I mock the selector … ?"
"1566492884.020700","Thu Aug 22 2019","12:54 PM","Matt Jardine","i guess you could also do it by mocking those functions that render the ProductOwnedHeader and checking if they are called or not"
"1566492886.020900","Thu Aug 22 2019","12:54 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Or do I just give the component props instead?"

"1567622242.015600","Wed Sep 04 2019","2:37 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Well, I think a lot of other parts are just keeping track of state—"

"1567622301.016900","Wed Sep 04 2019","2:38 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Like, `state.models.products.&lt;productId&gt;` is all the info for a product with that given ID—"

"1567622412.019700","Wed Sep 04 2019","2:40 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So, just looking at the shape of the store, I think having a top-level section (I still don’t know what to call that) that is `reviews` seems out of place."

No the basic gist is that NF got bought out by Hal Leonard and Joe Berkovitz got replaced by some douchebag named John Mlynczak and the site ever since has just gone downhill. The editor is far worse than it was even five years ago. It’s completely broken and writing for even a modestly sized ensemble induces immeasurable lag. Furthermore you have to realize the political environment at NF. It’s near Boston, and it’s one of those hippie-ish new age office environments, judging by the photos you can view online. Essentially they are all libcuck soyboys, full stop. So that explains why they went from an objective standard to this arbitrary hate speech BS that leftists so dearly love. NF John is an ill-tempered and incompetent buffoon and should be fired from the company."

Most days pass and I’m worried that something simple and wonderful just happened.  Some days in particular feel like a precious gem that I was allowed to hold for a moment, and if only I could do something I would be allowed to hold it longer—but it just slips through my fingers, lost to time.  So some days I try to write something down, to keep some record; but most days, I just mean to, and fall asleep instead.  But this week I found little records of these days hidden away in all sorts of places that I had deemed too shallow: in texts, in calendar appointments, in work Slack channels, screenshots, guestbook scrawlings and mostly Ivan’s phone.  Through them, I can hold these days again;  a strange and scattered treasure chest."

As always, take some time to analyze the overall performance needs of your own application."

"1574791702.025800","Tue Nov 26 2019","1:08 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","We should’ve not talked to you about commerce so you could come in!"
"1574791718.026100","Tue Nov 26 2019","1:08 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Oh well. Did you understand the conclusion?"
"1574791726.026400","Tue Nov 26 2019","1:08 PM","Matt Jardine","yeah, we are going to do Ken's bit"
"1574791740.026800","Tue Nov 26 2019","1:09 PM","Matt Jardine","I trust you guys to make the right call"
"1574791767.027800","Tue Nov 26 2019","1:09 PM","Matt Jardine","and anything I would have learned in that meeting would have been forgotten by the time I was actually working on anything"
"1574791773.028100","Tue Nov 26 2019","1:09 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I don’t actually fully have my head around Ken’s plan, and I blame that mostly on the fact that he didn’t have wonderful diagrams like Nate did."
"1574791789.028800","Tue Nov 26 2019","1:09 PM","Matt Jardine","honestly it felt useless for me to be in there, I was a little annoyed that the meeting was postponed"
"1574791804.029000","Tue Nov 26 2019","1:10 PM","Matt Jardine","Nate did have nice diagrams"
"1574791814.029400","Tue Nov 26 2019","1:10 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Aw"
"1574791824.029900","Tue Nov 26 2019","1:10 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Useless because … ?"
"1574791856.030700","Tue Nov 26 2019","1:10 PM","Matt Jardine","I don't think it's neccesarry for all of us to be involved at this stage"
"1574791857.030900","Tue Nov 26 2019","1:10 PM","Matt Jardine","I guess"
"1574791870.031200","Tue Nov 26 2019","1:11 PM","Matt Jardine","like, Ken and Nate did lots of research"
"1574791883.031500","Tue Nov 26 2019","1:11 PM","Matt Jardine","so their opinions are going to be much more valid than mine"
"1574791896.032000","Tue Nov 26 2019","1:11 PM","Matt Jardine","so it's not useful for me to be there in a _decision making_ capacity"
"1574791932.032900","Tue Nov 26 2019","1:12 PM","Matt Jardine","but it's also not useful for me to be there in a _learning_ capacity, because it's going to be a while before I have to apply whatever I was supposed to learn"
"1574791995.033700","Tue Nov 26 2019","1:13 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Mm. I hear that."
"1574791998.033900","Tue Nov 26 2019","1:13 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I liked being there. :slightly_smiling_face:"

"1574792048.035600","Tue Nov 26 2019","1:14 PM","Matt Jardine","I generally like being included in stuff"
"1574792049.035700","Tue Nov 26 2019","1:14 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Do you want to jump on a call to talk about timeline real quick?"
"1574792069.036200","Tue Nov 26 2019","1:14 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","That seems important to sort out sooner than later."
"1574792077.036600","Tue Nov 26 2019","1:14 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Sort out and discuss with the powers."
"1574792082.036800","Tue Nov 26 2019","1:14 PM","Matt Jardine","let's just talk tomorrow"

"1574792132.038700","Tue Nov 26 2019","1:15 PM","Matt Jardine","yes!"
"1574792133.038900","Tue Nov 26 2019","1:15 PM","Matt Jardine","haha"
"1574792141.039200","Tue Nov 26 2019","1:15 PM","Matt Jardine","less so than last week though maybe?"
"1574792151.039700","Tue Nov 26 2019","1:15 PM","Matt Jardine","but that might be because I got to sleep more and I haven't had to move basically at all"
"1574792197.039900","Tue Nov 26 2019","1:16 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Mm that’s nice."

"1574797255.045400","Tue Nov 26 2019","2:40 PM","Matt Jardine","Ok"
"1574797338.045600","Tue Nov 26 2019","2:42 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I have some questions about your PR"
"1574797376.046500","Tue Nov 26 2019","2:42 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","There are two similar files: `googleAnalyticsEvents.js` and `googleAnalytics.js`"

"1574797476.047700","Tue Nov 26 2019","2:44 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Like, see your clicks tracking?"

"1574798852.049900","Tue Nov 26 2019","3:07 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Also this revealed to me that my grasp of asynchronous functions and Promises is pretty shaky."

"1574798936.051100","Tue Nov 26 2019","3:08 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Following the thread of all this was somewhat difficult."
"1574798972.052000","Tue Nov 26 2019","3:09 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Haha, yeah, I can’t tell if this is entirely because of shaky understanding or if we would ideally write this differently, if we weren’t rushed for time."
"1574798998.052700","Tue Nov 26 2019","3:09 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But honestly I do think most of it is my lack of experience with handling asynchronous stuff."
"1574799108.053400","Tue Nov 26 2019","3:11 PM","Matt Jardine","that file includes callbacks, promises, _and_ async/await"
"1574799125.053800","Tue Nov 26 2019","3:12 PM","Matt Jardine","maybe there's a better way"

"1576077542.010600","Wed Dec 11 2019","10:19 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","YES. So many places I would prefer to work. At the moment, this being one of them."
"1576077552.011000","Wed Dec 11 2019","10:19 AM","Matt Jardine","so why are you doing this?"
"1576077558.011200","Wed Dec 11 2019","10:19 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I was answering _why_ to why I am having lunch with this person."
"1576077572.011600","Wed Dec 11 2019","10:19 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Or coffee."
"1576077576.011800","Wed Dec 11 2019","10:19 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Unclear, it’s at 2:30."
"1576077583.012200","Wed Dec 11 2019","10:19 AM","Matt Jardine","you don't even LIKE coffee"
"1576077597.012500","Wed Dec 11 2019","10:19 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","That’s true I’ll get hot chocolate."
"1576077618.013000","Wed Dec 11 2019","10:20 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Anyway, the reason I have this _appointment_ with this person is because the _appointment_ just fell in my lap."
"1576077634.013400","Wed Dec 11 2019","10:20 AM","Matt Jardine","that's not how appointments work"
"1576077647.014000","Wed Dec 11 2019","10:20 AM","Matt Jardine","you don't have to do everything people tell you to"
"1576077661.014300","Wed Dec 11 2019","10:21 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Like, I didn’t have to go out of my way for it at all; I didn’t set it up, I’m just agreeing."

"1576077674.015100","Wed Dec 11 2019","10:21 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yes this is also true."
"1576077677.015500","Wed Dec 11 2019","10:21 AM","Matt Jardine","do you know how many emails I get from recruiters?"

"1576077887.020800","Wed Dec 11 2019","10:24 AM","Matt Jardine","yeah but like of all places"
"1576077894.021100","Wed Dec 11 2019","10:24 AM","Matt Jardine","this is such a disaster"
"1576077921.021400","Wed Dec 11 2019","10:25 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Like, updating my resume doesn’t mean I’m looking for a new job."
"1576077936.021900","Wed Dec 11 2019","10:25 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","The only thing that means anything is that NOT updating my resume means I _can’t_ look for a new job."

"1576525267.008200","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:41 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","My question was a trick question!"
"1576525289.008800","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:41 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I want to know where you get your idea of what a “senior engineer” is."
"1576525338.009400","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:42 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Sorry to bring up a sore subject, but I just need it for illustration:"
"1576525370.010200","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:42 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","edX has an internal rubric for engineering levels. By their rubric, I’m either senior or _very_ close to it."
"1576525402.010700","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:43 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So you’d _definitely_ be senior, no questions."
"1576525422.011200","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:43 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But that just made me realize that there are vastly different understandings of what “senior” means—"
"1576525428.011500","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:43 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","and so where do we get our idea?"
"1576525483.012000","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:44 PM","Matt Jardine","yeah, this is a good question"
"1576525495.012600","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:44 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And like, where do people who are applying for this “senior” position get their idea?"
"1576525522.013000","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:45 PM","Matt Jardine","I guess we haven't defined it exactly"
"1576525529.013400","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:45 PM","Matt Jardine","but there are some basic assumptions"
"1576525559.013900","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:45 PM","Matt Jardine","like senior implies more experience than the average developer"
"1576525568.014200","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:46 PM","Matt Jardine","whatever _that_ is"
"1576525609.014500","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:46 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But see, it _doesn’t_ at edX."
"1576525622.015100","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:47 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Like, “senior” is actually less than half way up the totem pole."
"1576525625.015300","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:47 PM","Matt Jardine","are there levels after senior?"
"1576525626.015500","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:47 PM","Matt Jardine","ah"
"1576525670.016400","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:47 PM","Matt Jardine","I wonder what the value is for having that many distinctions"
"1576525683.016900","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:48 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Ah, for instance, look at this post about Google’s levels: <https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-different-levels-of-software-engineers-at-Google>"
"1576525729.017400","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:48 PM","Matt Jardine","yeah that's quite a few rungs"
"1576525777.018200","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:49 PM","Matt Jardine","I like john's approach of just hiring people that we like and think will help us and not worrying too much about roles"
"1576525784.018500","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:49 PM","Matt Jardine","that's been the NF way in my experience so far"
"1576525802.019100","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:50 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yeah, that makes a better team."
"1576525805.019300","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:50 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Probably."
"1576525821.019800","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:50 PM","Matt Jardine","I bet having a lot of ranks like that makes sense for bigger teams"
"1576525862.020600","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:51 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But then I think we should’ve looked at way more juniors."
"1576525922.021600","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:52 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Like, if it’s really about liking the people and not the skills, then we can be less picky."
"1576525929.021800","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:52 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Haha, or _more_ picky."
"1576525931.022000","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:52 PM","Matt Jardine","well"
"1576525939.022300","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:52 PM","Matt Jardine","I think it's still about the skills"
"1576525968.022800","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:52 PM","Matt Jardine","but there isn't just a single dimension that denotes 'skills'"
"1576526017.024000","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:53 PM","Matt Jardine","I think there could be a value in having a progression of 'ranks' like that internally to show people they are progressing and for organizing (though I do have criticisms of this)"
"1576526035.024500","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:53 PM","Matt Jardine","but as you have discovered these terms don't translate from company to company"
"1576526053.025100","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:54 PM","Matt Jardine","and a person who have written java for 7 years might be a senior at some places, but maybe not here"

"1576526112.025900","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:55 PM","Matt Jardine","I would hate to hire somebody who is a 'senior engineer' and that makes you feel like you have to do whatever they say, even if you think they are wrong"

"1576526129.026500","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:55 PM","Matt Jardine","nobody can 'pull rank'"
"1576526152.027000","Mon Dec 16 2019","2:55 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Huh. I didn’t think of the “senior” title as coming with power."

"1577122727.014700","Mon Dec 23 2019","12:38 PM","Matt Jardine","There browser doesnt know how to get files off of your file system"
"1577122743.015500","Mon Dec 23 2019","12:39 PM","Matt Jardine","It helps me understand things to explain them"
"1577122756.015800","Mon Dec 23 2019","12:39 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Does that mean that you can’t do basic imports without “serving” them somehow?"
"1577122776.016500","Mon Dec 23 2019","12:39 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Or packaging them, maybe?"
"1577122817.017500","Mon Dec 23 2019","12:40 PM","Matt Jardine","Well, if you use html script or style tags browsers can figure out stuff from relative paths"
"1577122836.018000","Mon Dec 23 2019","12:40 PM","Matt Jardine","But that's it, and it kind of confuses things"

"1577122941.020100","Mon Dec 23 2019","12:42 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Okay, so is that it?"
"1577122957.021200","Mon Dec 23 2019","12:42 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Like, you have to download something to let you serve files locally?"
"1577122968.021700","Mon Dec 23 2019","12:42 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","There’s not a built-in, on-your-machine-way of doing that?"
"1577122972.022000","Mon Dec 23 2019","12:42 PM","Matt Jardine","It will accept http requests on a port, and serve files from the file system"
"1577123020.022900","Mon Dec 23 2019","12:43 PM","Matt Jardine","There might be something like this built in on a Mac, but I don't know it if so"
"1577123080.023600","Mon Dec 23 2019","12:44 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So is `html` with script/style tags the only kind of file that can find other files based on relative paths without having to have them served?"
"1577123093.024100","Mon Dec 23 2019","12:44 PM","Matt Jardine","Yeah I think so"
"1577123105.024800","Mon Dec 23 2019","12:45 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","… why"

"1577123177.025600","Mon Dec 23 2019","12:46 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Heh"
"1577123224.026500","Mon Dec 23 2019","12:47 PM","Matt Jardine","The web is about communicating between multiple computers"
"1577123267.027000","Mon Dec 23 2019","12:47 PM","Matt Jardine","Over http"
"1577123301.027500","Mon Dec 23 2019","12:48 PM","Matt Jardine","Something needs to be listening to respond to the requests"
"1577123333.028600","Mon Dec 23 2019","12:48 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But in the html case it’s all included in the one request, right?"
"1577123355.028800","Mon Dec 23 2019","12:49 PM","Matt Jardine","Yeah"
"1577123359.029000","Mon Dec 23 2019","12:49 PM","Matt Jardine","Well hmm"
"1577123397.030200","Mon Dec 23 2019","12:49 PM","Matt Jardine","I think it would normally be multiple requests with style/script/image tags"
"1577123447.031700","Mon Dec 23 2019","12:50 PM","Matt Jardine","But browser manufacturers made it so you can do it from the file system just to let people mess around easier"
"1577123458.032100","Mon Dec 23 2019","12:50 PM","Matt Jardine","At least that's why I imagine it works"
"1577123497.032600","Mon Dec 23 2019","12:51 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","If I included the .json file in an html script tag or something, could the .js file access it then?"
"1577123506.032900","Mon Dec 23 2019","12:51 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","(Without needing a local server?)"
"1577123524.033200","Mon Dec 23 2019","12:52 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Because it would all be up there in the browser already?"
"1577123614.033800","Mon Dec 23 2019","12:53 PM","Matt Jardine","I don't _think_ that will work"
"1577123627.034400","Mon Dec 23 2019","12:53 PM","Matt Jardine","Because what is the browser supposed to do with that file?"
"1577123667.034900","Mon Dec 23 2019","12:54 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I’d want to require or import it or something as a constant in my javascript file"

"1577123829.036900","Mon Dec 23 2019","12:57 PM","Matt Jardine","I think you need to make an Ajax request for the file (from a server) and then JSON.parse() it into a JavaScript object"
"1577123842.037100","Mon Dec 23 2019","12:57 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yeah seems like it."
"1577123874.038000","Mon Dec 23 2019","12:57 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","That is all for the guestbook/dataviz stuff I want to make—"

It seems the CG stuff was mostly just to add the fur; everything else was legit. Also, the choreographer from Hamilton choreographed this thing. 2. About CATS in general: it’s based on a series of poems from T. S. Elliot, and other material of his. It’s kind of remarkable how Andrew Lloyd Webber adapted Elliot’s scattered writings about cats into a broadway musical."

"1579793109.018700","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:25 AM","Matt Jardine","which is kind of like rails console or IRB"
"1579793127.019300","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:25 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","What’s the command line debugger?"
"1579793142.019700","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:25 AM","Matt Jardine","what they want you to do now is connect it to chrome to use the inspector there"
"1579793150.020200","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:25 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Ohhh hm."
"1579793163.020800","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:26 AM","Matt Jardine","the chrome tools are super good, so I'm not too upset about that"
"1579793170.021300","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:26 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yeah I thought there would be something _in_ terminal, yeah, like rails c or irb."
"1579793171.021400","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:26 AM","Matt Jardine","but yeah, it's more complicated"
"1579793182.022100","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:26 AM","Matt Jardine","so there is an in-terminal thing"
"1579793191.022500","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:26 AM","Matt Jardine","but I guess it's being deprecated :disappointed:"
"1579793192.022600","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:26 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I’m super used to debugging javascript in the browser console, so that was more realistic!"

"1579793362.026800","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:29 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Nah but this seems good/important to know, and like I’m not actually a javascript ace without it."

"1579793607.032500","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:33 AM","Matt Jardine","here's what I mean by ""it's great for light weight projects"""

"1579793707.034200","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:35 AM","Matt Jardine","^ that is all you need to make a server that takes requests on a port and responds with something"
"1579793735.034800","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:35 AM","Matt Jardine","in this case it always responds the same way, but you see how you could flesh it out to respond to different urls in different ways"
"1579793761.035200","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:36 AM","Matt Jardine","so if you have a project that doesn't need a very complicated server"
"1579793771.035600","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:36 AM","Matt Jardine","this will get you there really really fast"
"1579793777.035900","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:36 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Haha OH!"
"1579793790.036500","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:36 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Like, you can just use this instead of, say, _rails_."
"1579793796.036700","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:36 AM","Matt Jardine","yeah!!"
"1579793819.037400","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:36 AM","Matt Jardine","rails has all sorts of stuff set up for connecting to databases and making views with ERB templates"
"1579793825.037800","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:37 AM","Matt Jardine","but you might not need all of that"
"1579793841.038400","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:37 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Cool cool cool very cool very cool."
"1579793843.038700","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:37 AM","Matt Jardine","in fact people probably don't use the whole V part of the MVC framework very much any more"

"1579793862.039300","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:37 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","View?"
"1579793866.039500","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:37 AM","Matt Jardine","yeah"
"1579793878.040000","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:37 AM","Matt Jardine","we don't use ERB templates except for super old admin stuff"
"1579793884.040300","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:38 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Oh yes sorry missed that sentence earlier."
"1579793887.040600","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:38 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yep."
"1579793889.040700","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:38 AM","Matt Jardine","also, javascript is really great at asynchronous stuff"
"1579793914.041300","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:38 AM","Matt Jardine","which servers need to do all the time"
"1579793933.041900","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:38 AM","Matt Jardine","waiting for request, waiting for the database to respond, waiting for files on the filesystem to be read"
"1579793949.042300","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:39 AM","Matt Jardine","Rails just sits and waits while all that stuff happens, tying up the thread"
"1579793974.042900","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:39 AM","Matt Jardine","Node, instead, passes a callback to all of those I/O tasks and _takes new requests while it waits for them to respond_"
"1579793993.043400","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:39 AM","Matt Jardine","so if Rails and Node both only get a single process to work with Node is WAY faster"
"1579794019.044100","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:40 AM","Matt Jardine","which is maybe less exciting to you, but it's at least interesting in a computery way"

"1579794076.045300","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:41 AM","Matt Jardine","i think people say i/o when they talk about dealing with handing stuff off to other processes"
"1579794087.045600","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:41 AM","Matt Jardine","but I actually don't know I'm just pretending right now ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
"1579794139.046600","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:42 AM","Matt Jardine","to continue the Rails vs Node comparison, Rails is extremely opinionated about how code should be organized"
"1579794149.046900","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:42 AM","Matt Jardine","Node is much more free form"
"1579794165.047300","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:42 AM","Matt Jardine","that can be good but it can also be bad..."
"1579794194.047600","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:43 AM","Matt Jardine","ok that's more than you asked for"
"1579794196.047800","Thu Jan 23 2020","10:43 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yeah I like rules."

"1580237526.017600","Tue Jan 28 2020","1:52 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","but if I exaggerate my worry, it would be that he expects everything to be figured out in the Specify step, and any questions in <#C0739P2T1|dev-chat> after specify mean that we are doing things out of order."

"1580242530.032000","Tue Jan 28 2020","3:15 PM","Matt Jardine","i definitely like the idea of being in your commune"
"1580242542.032300","Tue Jan 28 2020","3:15 PM","Matt Jardine","especially since it looks like we aren't going abroad"

"1580242957.041600","Tue Jan 28 2020","3:22 PM","Matt Jardine","and, like, I'm getting to the point where I can afford it so I was sort of waiting for you two"

"1580243019.043200","Tue Jan 28 2020","3:23 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Okay these are great (and also terrible, but I mean very helpful) thoughts!"
"1580243043.043700","Tue Jan 28 2020","3:24 PM","Matt Jardine","yeah I will have to think about this more"
"1580243062.044200","Tue Jan 28 2020","3:24 PM","Matt Jardine","I think my desire to do this sort of thing with you guys outweighs my desire to not do it with corrin"

"1580243116.046100","Tue Jan 28 2020","3:25 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Okay maybe we should talk about this when Ivan is around, too. I don’t know that he knows you’re as interested as you are."

"1580243137.047100","Tue Jan 28 2020","3:25 PM","Matt Jardine","yeah I guess I should have made my intentions more clear"
"1580243155.047600","Tue Jan 28 2020","3:25 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I am just guessing but I imagine probably you and I have talked about it at least two times at work/in Slack for every 1 time it might have come up with Ivan, you know?"

"1580243171.048300","Tue Jan 28 2020","3:26 PM","Matt Jardine","like right now..."

"1580243289.050000","Tue Jan 28 2020","3:28 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Okay another question: Corrin aside, I think we have always been open to doing this with _more_ people generally. Is that true for you, too?"

"1580243323.052000","Tue Jan 28 2020","3:28 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yes of course."
"1580243332.052600","Tue Jan 28 2020","3:28 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","These are things to be thought about very seriously."
"1580243334.052700","Tue Jan 28 2020","3:28 PM","Matt Jardine","and the more units you need the fewer options there will be"
"1580243341.052900","Tue Jan 28 2020","3:29 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yep."

"1581437879.157200","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:17 AM","Matt Jardine","I am probably wrong then!"
"1581437885.157600","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:18 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Because then you have other offers to increase negotiation power etc."
"1581437892.157900","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:18 AM","Matt Jardine","but in that case I don't know how to avoid this sort of situation"
"1581437933.159200","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:18 AM","Matt Jardine","yeah i've heard that too. also for practice interviewing"
"1581437935.159300","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:18 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I think it would be different if Fathom was actively hiring for a position—their process might be more streamlined then. But because they’re not, it’ll be rather slow, Mark said."

"1581438027.161200","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:20 AM","Matt Jardine","since I already updated my resume and all that I figured I might as well start the job hunt in earnest"

"1581438052.162000","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:20 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","How long is forever in that case?"
"1581438055.162200","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:20 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","5 weeks?"
"1581438056.162500","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:20 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","3 months?"
"1581438091.163200","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:21 AM","Matt Jardine","I think it was about 1.5 months after the first real interview"
"1581438106.163500","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:21 AM","Matt Jardine","I had two other offers and they were threatening to move on"
"1581438127.163900","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:22 AM","Matt Jardine","in this case I would probably have just let them move on"
"1581438135.164200","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:22 AM","Matt Jardine","but that seems like a different situation than you are in"
"1581438190.165600","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:23 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Well, my whole point in starting looking was that I love Noteflight so I can afford to take my time and be picky."
"1581438222.166600","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:23 AM","Matt Jardine","that doesn't register with your statements about applying to Edx because it just fell into your lap :stuck_out_tongue:"
"1581438238.166800","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:23 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Wait, why not?"
"1581438247.167200","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:24 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I see those as entirely compatable."
"1581438261.167700","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:24 AM","Matt Jardine","isn't going with the first thing to fall into your lap the opposite of taking your time and being picky?"

"1581438269.168200","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:24 AM","Matt Jardine","you didn't pick them"
"1581438283.168600","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:24 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","No, that was the point! I can apply and don’t _have_ _to_ accept/go with them, because I can afford to be picky!"
"1581438335.169300","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:25 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I can use them to practice, prep my resume, all the other benefits, etc. because it fell in my lap."
"1581438352.169900","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:25 AM","Matt Jardine","okay"
"1581438456.171600","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:27 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","The thing that feels hard now is that if I get an offer at edX or HubSpot, they’d be offering between $100k–$115k, they said."
"1581438459.171900","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:27 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott",":disappointed:"
"1581438461.172200","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:27 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","That is very tempting."
"1581438475.172500","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:27 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Given that I make $74k now."
"1581438484.172800","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:28 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Like, that’s such a huge difference to me."
"1581438497.173300","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:28 AM","Matt Jardine","that is a _very_ big difference"
"1581438510.173800","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:28 AM","Matt Jardine","it's even a big difference from what you'd be getting here in may"
"1581438518.174100","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:28 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","And letting that pass by feels pretty scary."

"1581438520.174500","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:28 AM","Matt Jardine","I do think you should move on"

"1581438546.175100","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:29 AM","Matt Jardine","there's lots of reasons why going somewhere else would be good for you"
"1581438566.175400","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:29 AM","Matt Jardine","but you really _can_ afford to be picky"
"1581438574.175600","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:29 AM","Matt Jardine","about where you go"
"1581438576.175800","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:29 AM","Matt Jardine","that's all"
"1581438631.176600","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:30 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Obviously, I can literally _afford_ it. We live so comfortably."
"1581438641.177100","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:30 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","I guess I am just being greedy."
"1581438660.177500","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:31 AM","Matt Jardine","well, you two have goals that involve having lots of money"
"1581438671.177700","Tue Feb 11 2020","11:31 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Oh! Speaking of …"

"1581440451.178700","Tue Feb 11 2020","12:00 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","By the way, I think the way you set up the technical phone screen you administered was awesome."

"1581448764.188900","Tue Feb 11 2020","2:19 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Are there dialogs that pop up from things done in the white page part?"

"1581449938.191600","Tue Feb 11 2020","2:38 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","So all the palette stuff has never been included in that."
"1581449945.191900","Tue Feb 11 2020","2:39 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Because that is all part of “client”"

"1581708012.296000","Fri Feb 14 2020","2:20 PM","Matt Jardine","maybe you aren't being properly respected around here"

"1582230039.375900","Thu Feb 20 2020","3:20 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Probably JavaScript, yeah."

"1582230078.377500","Thu Feb 20 2020","3:21 PM","Matt Jardine","well, edX seems to call out JS specifically"

"1582230168.379500","Thu Feb 20 2020","3:22 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","One could’ve been the official communication from HubSpot."

"1582644717.008000","Tue Feb 25 2020","10:31 AM","Matt Jardine","that would be interesting to experience at least for a while"

"1582644951.014700","Tue Feb 25 2020","10:35 AM","Matt Jardine","yeah the bigger the company the smaller the impact it feels like you are making"
"1582644955.015000","Tue Feb 25 2020","10:35 AM","Matt Jardine","that's something I like about tiny companies"
"1582644968.015500","Tue Feb 25 2020","10:36 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Also, their philosophy on team switching is the opposite:"

"1582645067.018600","Tue Feb 25 2020","10:37 AM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","Yeah, and if you can switch all the time, it probably feels like you have had a bunch of different jobs."

"1583265722.038300","Tue Mar 03 2020","3:02 PM","Olivia Ruiz-Knott","But yeah, I think there are ways I could buckle down and grow here, but that would need some conversation. Like, I’d want some sort of agreement around that."
